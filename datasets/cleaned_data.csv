Do scratches affect trade in value for a iPhone 11 Pro Max?,"I am looking to trade in my 11 Pro Max and would like to get as much value as possible. I used apples estimator and just based on what I think the scratches would drop the value down to $200 or so versus $500. 

Do scratches really have that big of an impact on trading in? Just seems kind of silly to me especially since replacing the screen would only cost $29 through Apple Care (and I’m sure far less for apple despite the fact that the phone is going to get recycled anyway). 

I can upload some images if it would help to better provide support. 

Anyone have insight on their past experiences with trading in iPhones with scratches?",iphone

iPhone 12 green tint problem is indeed a thermal management issue,"Hey Guys,
In the past few months i've had one iPhone 12 Pro and four iPhone 12 Pro Max. I returned most of them because of the green tint issue. The black flickering got fixed in 14.5 Beta 2 for me. Now i figured to try if temperature would matter. The picture with noticable green tint was shot when the device was used normally at room temperature. The picture without any issues (apart from some Oled uniformity which i dont care about too much) was shot after playing Genshin Impact on highest settings for about 20-25 minutes. The device obviously was noticeably warmer. And there wasn't any green tint. I think it's the same fix like i think it was in iOS 13.6.2, which fixed the green tint for the iPhone 11 Pro models which was caused due to thermal management. Just wanted to let you guys know and maybe try yourself.
Device was manufactered in mid February, Pacific Blue, Samsung Display i think it was G9Q or something. Second grade Samsung panel
Cheers

iPhone 13 : A better Face ID instead of Touch ID ?,"Last week, Kuo tempered our hopes concerning the return of Touch ID. The tech will maybe not come back this year. But what if, instead of Touch ID, we get a improved Face ID ? 
With a more precise scan, and a improved AI, Face ID could work even with a mask, by scanning the distance between the eyes, the ears and some other particular points of our faces.

Reddit app all of a sudden overheating iPhone 12 Pro?,Has this been happening to anyone else?

This only started happening in the last week or so and it’s only with the Reddit app.,iphone
Owners of iPhones with 2 rear cameras: How many of you would have preferred a 2x Telephoto lens instead of the 0.5x Ultra Wide lens?,"Personally I love taking portrait shots, where 1-2 people are the primary focus with some of the background showing up. With the 1x lens on my iPhone 11, I find that it isn't close enough. When I move closer, faces don't look as flattering.

I would have loved a 2x lens as the other lens for shots like this, which is like 60-70% of what I used to shoot with a digital camera (it had 12x optical zoom). But instead we are stuck with a 0.5x camera which captures much more, but the excess part is almost always too distorted. Whenever I use that lens, I find the distortion to be so bad that I end up deleting most of those 0.5x lens shots. The only place where that lens produces somewhat usable results is in vast open places in nature. In a cityscape or indoors, perfectly straight lines such as door frames, room corners, building edges, etc. appear weird. 

Perhaps a big reason for this is the focal length of the cameras. What we naturally see is probably around 43mm. The 2x Telephoto lens is 52mm, the 2.5x lens is 65mm. But the 1x Wide lens is 26mm and the 0.5x Ultra Wide lens is 13mm, both far too removed from what we actually see.

I would have loved to see the 2x lens instead of the 0.5x lens. What are your opinions?",iphone
Can't receive texts from androids?,"EDIT:problem solved, thank you all who commented!

Hello I hope someone can help me, up until a couple hours ago I was using a google pixel 3a xl and now I have finally joined the iphone gang for the first time (iphone 11). I backed up my pixel, turned it off, took out it's sim and put the sim in the iphone. I turned on my pixel and my iphone, downloaded the app where you move data from android to ios and I set up my iphone.

I am now able to send and receive texts from other iphones, however my mom and my boyfriend (mom has a samsung and boyfriend has a pixel) cannot send me texts to my iphone. Instead when they text me, my pixel receives it, even though it has no sim card (it is connected to wifi)! If it (the pixel) disconnects from wifi or if it is off, my iphone still will not receive the texts but the pixel will as soon as it is powered back on or reconnected to wifi.

Also, when my mom called me (on my iphone) I received the call but it said ""no caller id"" even though she is in my contacts. When my boyfriend called it went through and showed his contact.

Another thing to note: my iphone can send my mom and my borfriend texts and they receive it.

At first I was thinking it was because they have androids, however I had my uncle text me (he has an Alcatel) and I was able to receive his text on my iphone.",iphone
Can Face ID unlock your phone with a face mask on?,"I've recently noticed (around 3 days ago) that my iPhone is able to unlock my phone even with a face mask on, covering the nose and mouth. It even works for Apple Pay!

It's not 100% reliable however, it works better the further down the mask is on the nose bridge.

I have not done anything since I registered the face ID back in November 2020.

I'm using an iPhone 12 Pro running iOS 14.4

Notch Is What Fingerprint Button Was To iPhone,"There has been rumours recently that future iPhones will have a hole punch instead of the notch.

Initially I was excited to hear, but then got to thinking that perhaps this is not a good thing! The key word here is design identity! 

Ever since the original was released, the iPhone could be instantly identified by the circular button at the bottom of the phone. Then when the notch came along, same deal...instantly identifiable as an iPhone from the front profile.

If apple do remove the notch for either a hole 🕳 punch or even under screen camera etc, then from a casual glance, future iPhones will look like every other chocolate bar slab phone from the front!",iphone

Does the iPhone 12pro really need a screen protector?,"So I’ve been an iPhone user for the last 10 years from the 4 all the way up now to the 12Pro and have always used screen protectors mostly for peace of mind. The 12/12Pro is claimed to have much stronger glass and overall be a much tougher phone than any previous iPhone (standard apple marketing of course). I’ve always used a glass screen protector on my iPhone for years and while it does serve a function, it does look a little tacky. 

I rarely ever drop my phone and take pretty good care of it and the glass screen protectors very very rarely get scratched or chipped anyway (assuming they also use a much weaker and lower grade glass than the current iPhone screen glass too). 

Is there minimal risk using no screen protector on the 12pro and have people used theirs without one and had no issues?",iphone

iPhone X: found a way to get rid of black screen on both cameras,"So I got an iPhone X of eBay pretty cheap with only one working camera at the time, I knew that the previous owner had dropped it and there is a bulge in the top Frame, which was pretty much the reason the front-facing camera didn't work, I figured. I replaced the battery and the malfunctioning camera, but all the sudden both cameras didn't work, which was a bummer for me, so I tried getting it fixed by professionals, and after 3 months of waiting they told me that the motherboard was damaged and I would have to buy a new one. Because of financial reasons, I did not do that and just carried on with my broken, no camera phone. Until three days ago where I finally downloaded the Paypal-App to the Phone and accidentally tapped on the QR-code camera, from there both cameras managed to be displayed and worked in every other app as well.

TLTR: If you have problems with your iPhone X camera only showing a black screen, try downloading the Paypal-App and using the QR-Scanner function, got mine working again.",iphone
Preparing to jump ship after 10 years of Samsung phones. I need some tips from people who made a similar switch.,"Hey everyone! So currently I have a Galaxy S10 which I'm satisfied with for now. However, I think I will part ways with Samsung due to them desperately trying to copy Apple (most copying the bad traits unfortunately).

I'm mainly waiting for the 120hz display on an iPhone, so I keep my fingers crossed it will be on the next one. The thing is, I love my current phone, don't get me wrong. But Samsung's price increase plus the removal of the headphone jack, micro SD slot and recently the power brick and headphones were the last straw. Might as well change to the brand they are so desparately trying to copy then. However, I will miss installing custom APKs and YT Vanced and I don't want to jailbreak the iPhone. But at least I will have a phone without late or buggy updates for years to come.

Anyway, rant over. Please give me some tips if you have any. The last iPhone I had is the 4, so I wanna know if iOS still feels very closed like it used to be? And is it true that Apple slows down your iPhone as soon as the new one comes out?

EDIT: Thanks for the feedback everyone! I think I'll take the plunge and switch to iOS. I also prefer my third party apps to be better optimized. However, I will wait for a while for the iPhone that comes our this year or in 2022. By that time I hope the notch will at least be smaller and we get a dynamic 120hz refresh rate.",iphone

Does anyone else feel the same way?,"So I have an iPhone 8 Plus. The only reason I haven’t gotten a new phone is because I like the phone like this. The main reason is the home button. I like just having a physical button to press.

My frustration is that the iPhone 8 Plus is the newest phone with a big screen AND a home button. I know that the iPhone SE has a home button, but they don’t have a larger option with that model.

Like as i said before, I’m currently fine with the phone i have, but as time goes on the iPhone 8+ will get phased out from updates. I just think Apple really needs to up their game with the SE in the future",iphone

Roommate’s phone and my phone calling each other mysteriously?,"Okay I’ve been using an iPhone for over a decade now, and I’ve never encountered anything like this before.

Obviously confused I looked over at him assuming he’d butt dialed me, only to see that he was receiving a call from me at the same time. We both answered, and could hear each other fine just like a normal phone call. We just shrugged it off but had it happen again about 2 minutes later, so this time we let it go to voicemail on both sides. I didn’t receive anything, but he got a 42 second voicemail that just sounded like static or possibly computer fans.

I bought an iPhone 12 this January coming from a 7 and I was wondering if, aside from charging speed, there is an actual long term benefit in using one charging method instead of the other.

I read about people saying magsafe should make it last longer because it operates at 15W instead of the lighting charging at 20W, but it may also decrease the battery life because wireless charging produces quite some heat which causes batteries to degrade faster.

Does iMessage capture keystrokes?,"We're watching a documentary on Netflix (""American Murder: The Family Next Door"") and they're showing a lot of text messages going back and forth. I noticed the wife's messages keep being backspaced to fix typos - none of the friends or family's texts are doing that. Clearly the texts aren't being displayed in real time, but I'm wondering if it was some weird editorial decision on the part of Netflix, or if text logs somehow might have shown that the wife actually did correct her typos before sending and they left it in for accuracy. Any ideas?",iphone

"Judging by the majority of posts I see, I must be in the minority: I switched from the 12mini to the 12Pro. Mixed emotions.","Most posts I’ve seen - granted, I only skimmed around the sub - seem to be full of people going from 12PM/12P to the Mini. I did the opposite (12m &gt; 12P). 

Let me start by saying...I am writing this because I simply want to help other people make their buying decisions easier. And I feel like I’m pretty unbiased, as I’ve had both the 11, 11P, 12m, and 12P (no I’m not rich, I just do a lot of swapping, trading, and taking advantage of deals I find here and there). 

I absolutely loved the mini. LOVED it. The weight. The size. Everything. Except .... two major issues:

1. Battery. I don’t want to have to alter a dozen settings as battery saving techniques just to eke out a few extra %’s during the day. All the SoT posts (5-7 hours, some even claiming an entire day or more) on r/iPhone12mini simply never worked for me. I’m not even a heavy user either - no videos, no games, just emails and simple web browsing, a few podcasts, 30min a day cap on social media, etc. 

Yet two hours into the day I was hovering around 50%... And while it was never a true issue, per se, since I’m always around a charger during the COVID era...hot damn it sucked being out and about (or worse - traveling) - and worrying about battery %. 

2. As much as I loved the size *in theory*, it was too small in practice (unpopular opinion-I know!!). Why? Because it was too big for one handed use typing, and too small for two handed use (and too small for reading kindle or longer articles or writing longer emails). Maybe I didn’t explain my aversion to the size well, but .... there was just something awkward about it. It’s almost like I wish it was either smaller or ... well hell, yeah - smaller ;) 

I kept trying to find my groove between one handed typing and two and never got it down. 

My love hate with the 12P:

I love the 12P. Period. But then again, I loved the 12 mini. 

1. Here we are again with size. I’m extremely happy that my reading experience has improved greatly with the change. Typing, too. Everything feels scaled perfectly and it’s not too big for one handed *typing* use (it’s a tad too big for one handed drag-down use, which I’ve remedied with the back-tap motion to bring the screen down for reachability. I guess I just feel like my 12P looks more like a 12PM. Why was it so hard for Apple to stick to that X/11P size sweet spot? :D

2. The wallet. I LOVED the MagSafe wallet on my mini. It fit like a glove! Didn’t budge at all, felt safe and strong (when it was directly on the phone - without the case - it was actually hard to get off sometimes. But with the 12P, the Wallet - seriously - hardly stays on! Every time I move it shifts a bit. It also looks a bit awkward on the naked phone. Getting the black leather MagSafe case in the mail today so hopefully it sticks a bit stronger. 

OVERALL....

On the one hand, I wish the mini worked out for me. I loved that mini phone! The phone that was mini but simultaneously too mini yet not mini enough :) 

Yet I’m happy I moved to the 12P. It just fit my needs more. But I do wonder - once the newness of the 12P wears off - and the bigness starts to weigh on me (literally and not so literally), will I want to switch back?

Mixed messages I know but maaaaybe it helps someone? I can wish! 

(FWIW, it would have taken me eons of type this with my mini - lots of mistakes and typos - but is taking me half the time on the 12P)",iphone

IPhone XS Max,"Ive been holding on to my 7+ for almost 4 1/2 years.  Replaced the battery at 2 and am now almost at the point it would need  another one (low 80s). And it seems to have occasion dead spots on the screen so before it puts me in the position of I need one now I figured out was time to look. 

I’ve  waited patiently for Verizon to offer up some kind of deal on a newer phone but the 11s came and went and now we are into the 12s and they don’t seem to ever offer anything for existing customers and since I’m not really wanting to spend $1100 of a new phone I’m looking at refurbs.

The XS Max seems to fit the bill and I have about $100 in verizon bucks so it brings the price down even more to something reasonable. 

Has the XS been a good reliable phone and still worth getting it 2021? 

FWIW I have bigger hands and full size pockets and larger frame of the 7+ with a case is easier to hold. They make a bigger deal of the cameras on the Pro models My main issue is screen real estate.

iPhone 11 thoughts after about 1.5 year of usage,"tldr and summarization of this definitely too long post is in its last paragraph.

Today a thought went through my head when watching some tech news YouTube video and I thought of sharing it here.

Just for some background, I used to switch phones in every 6 months or so. 

This kind of changed when I bought OG iPhone SE - my first iPhone. I used it for a year but it's camera quality while consistent was somewhat lacking. I switched it for Huawei P9. Its photos quality was mind blowing compared to the SE. Image sharpness felt really next-gen compared to the iPhone. Not to mention it's long exposure mode and lowlight/night photo quality was mind blowing at the time.

But I missed iPhone and iOS. Its fluid animations, reliability and went back to another SE after almost another year. Got an used 6s plus for my wife as well to check how embracing the iMessage airdrop and such would feel as none of my contacts had iPhones at the time. It was pretty neat that we could bind our iCloud accounts as family and to be able to check each other's location (no more calling to check if I'm on my way from work already or if wife is returning from uni yet), iMessage was pretty neat and allowed me to mostly drop usage of FB message as I text my wife the most, airdrop is more convenient than BT as well.

After some time I thought of getting something with better camera for low light shots and iPhones did not deliver that compared to Android ones (night sight was around for about a year then). I bought Xiaomi Mi Mix 2s which has amazing build quality and was able to run google camera mod with night sight. Again low light photos or even those indoors were awesome compared to good old SE, bigger screen was awesome, battery great but it felt like an iPhone ripoff - great made though. I was genuinely happy with this phone, bought some more into Android ecosystem by getting the Samsung Galaxy Watch 46mm which is pretty great smart watch to be honest (nice design not to mention 5 day battery life). 

But there were few reasons that I wish I had an iPhone. 

• As Samsung Watch does not work with GPay and supports only Samsung Pay, I was not able to pay with it as Samsung Pay is not available in my country. I was thinking of getting an Apple Watch instead which works only with an iPhone. 

• Missed some apps that I had on iPhone (like Apollo). 

• My wife as well as my in laws and brother that all bought iPhones in the meantime were complaining that we cannot use iMessage (that grew on us a lot) anymore. 

• I got a MacBook instead Dell as my work laptop and wanted to try going into the ecosystem more.

As the iPhone 11 release was coming closer we decided to sell my wife's 6s+ as it still kept its vale quite high and bought XR. It turned out to have great battery life that was tempting to me. But I decided to wait 2 more months and see what will 11 offer.

And here it was same as XR but with wide angle camera and night mode. Its form factor was very similar to my Mi Mix 2s. I went for the change. Gave my old phone to my mother (she still uses it and is more that happy with it) and bought the 11 in the first week after release. After getting the phone I found someone wanting to trade his 1 month old Apple Watch for Samsung watch, paired my MacBook with my iCloud account and have experienced real bliss of not having to look use my phone at all during work since I can reply to texts from my laptop :)

Then I bought Apple Watch for my wife as well for walkie talkie and activity challenges.

The though that got to me was since I got iPhone 11 it checks all the boxes for me. Great battery, wireless charging, great low light camera performance, good enough screen, iOS with more and more features after updates (proper implementation of dark mode, great interface to select audio output), great smart watch with Apple Pay, Apple Pay in general that allows me to pay for e-commerce shopping, how great it works with AirPods and MacBook, great selection of accessories for both iPhone and Apple Watch and so much more. 

The realization was that in about 1.5 year I have not thought of getting any other phone even once! And as my max battery capacity is down to 87% I think when it reaches that 80% I will very unlikely change my phone and get the battery replaced instead. Never thought it would happen to me to be honest.",iphone
I’m ready for an overhaul of the native iOS video player,"It seems like the native iOS player is really lagging behind other 3rd party implementations. The reddit client app Apollo is really built well, and I love how it scrubs my moving your finger horizontally on the screen. YouTube’s double tap to skip gesture is really useful too. 

The native video player hasn’t been updated in sometime, and they could really use some new features. 

-	It’s frustrating using the scrubber to navigate playback or change the volume. We shouldn’t have to first find and place a finger on that tiny dial to drag. And anytime I try to get to a particular time using the dial, lifting my finger always move it off my target
-	It still has rewind/fast forward buttons, which feel better for a TV remote than a touchscreen device. Tapping once should skip by a certain amount while holding the button should rewind/fast forward

I’m hoping the next version of iOS gives their video player controls some love.

Today I contacted support asking if they were actually sending that box and was told that I can’t do a standard upgrade. Instead, I have to do a “trade-in”, get a gift card, and then give the gift card details to them that they will use to pay off the loan (even though the loan is larger than the gift card).

PSA: You can cancel &amp; refund AppleCare at any time,"If you are like me and get a new iPhone/iPad every year, and use AppleCare, it's good to know that you can cancel AppleCare and get a prorata refund at any time.

Here is what the Apple website says.

    You may cancel AppleCare+ at any time. If you have not made any claims and you cancel within 30 days of purchasing AppleCare+, you will receive a full refund. If you have not made any claims and cancel after this 30-day period, you will receive a pro-rata refund depending on how long you have had AppleCare+. If you have made a claim and received a benefit under AppleCare+, the value of such benefit will be deducted from any refund. This may result in no refund being due to you.

Last year I paid £199 for AC for my 11 Pro Max and in October when I receieved my new 12 Pro I got a refund for about £170. This then obviously helps offset the cost for this years AppleCare.

[Screen Protector] Tempered glass = Tempered glass? And what makes PanzerGlass different?,"A friend of mine had 3 display replacement within the last 2.5 years. I know that a screen protector can't do magic tricks, but should protect the screen to some amount.

Looking through online shops and even here on reddit, people mostly recommend tempered glass as screen protectors. The price varies from 2$ up to 15$ and I was wondering, if there are any big differences between tempered glass' screen protector beside probably a no-brand and brand brand.

Moreover, she always used [PanzerGlass](https://panzerglass.com/products/panzerglass-iphone-11-pro-privacy) which costed 30$ (!!). What is the difference between these screen protectors and tempered glass?  
On their website, i found this text:

&gt;PanzerGlass™ screen protectors are made of real glass of the highest  quality, ensuring superior protection of your device. PanzerGlass™  screen protectors have a thickness of at least 0.4 mm, whereas many of  our competitors go down to 0.2 mm. **Paired with the latest advancements  in tempered glass, PanzerGlass™** are able to offer one of the strongest  screen protection solutions out there.

iPhone is ALWAYS a guarantee.,"I’m a smartphone and technology passionate, not Apple or Android fan at all. Two weeks ago i stopped using the iPhone 12 as my main phone because i wanted to try a 2021 Android so i bought the S21, but two weeks later (today) i changed my SIM card to the iPhone again because I Couldn’t... i couldn’t handle the Exynos 2100 processor performance and the battery drain issue that cause the poor optimization of the Samsung OneUi  interface (Not Android but OneUi)
It feels so good coming back to a safe zone with a processor and an OS optimized 100%. This confirms the theory that iPhone (and Apple) is ALWAYS a guarantee. Everything’s ok with Samsung, but I fought so hard with their new flagship performance (this was the only issue i faced, for the rest the S21 is a monster to with high flagship functionalities).

Can FaceTime please get some overhaul?,"My lord. As much as I love FaceTime, it has a few issues and lack some features that makes me want to jump to other video calling apps. Here’s just some suggestions I feel that could make FaceTime a much better platform for video calling: 

1. Either allow FT Live Photo’s to be recorded longer than 3 seconds, or recording with audio. I love recording my friends doing the silliest things but I honestly don’t see a point if there’s no audio output. Either that or just 3 seconds. Also, I don’t understand the point of the “_____ took a screenshot!” Notification if you can just take a regular screenshot, or screen record without the other person knowing anyways. 

2. More to do on the call. For example, iMessage having the text effects. Just cool little effects to make calls more engaging and intuitive. Right now all you can do is a couple of stickers, emojis, and Memojis. If you’re FaceTiming someone to ask them where they are, instead of us leaving the call to go to find my or iMessage, give us an option to display it on FaceTime itself. 

3. Option for a real-time transcript on what a person is saying. Pretty helpful in situations when you can’t hear due to loud volume. Kinda like what happens in Apple Clips, where it pops up as an option at the bottom to follow along. 

Edit: Maybe even the translator app support(?) If it’s not entirely buggy. 

4. Support for music player/Siri while in a call. If you want to use Siri, it hangs up the call. If you’re listening to music and want to change the song using AirPods/Powerbeats Pro, it hangs up the call. This may seem useless but when I’m playing a game with some friends and I got a massive phone with tiny fingers, it can be a bit difficult to swap in between to change music. 

5. Also a little bug I personally get which bugs the hell out of me is FaceTime constantly disconnecting and connecting itself from Data to WiFi when I’m at home. It gets super annoying. 

6. For iPhone X+ users, remove the bar at the bottom. This is a little nitpicky but idk I feel that it doesn’t need to be there.",iphone

Regretting update to ios 14.4 on 7plus,"Looking for some sort of light at the end of the tunnel here. I loved loved loved my 7Plus on ios 13.7, couldn't have been happier really. I kept reading about ios 14 security features but wanted to wait until the reports of battery drain improved. Finally decided to take the plunge with 14.4 because it seemed like the right thing to do, but I hate it. I don't see the point of these widgets, and while all my apps work fine I just don't like the look and feel of 14.4 at all. Also I've noticed a constant drip of increased battery drain, even after turning off Siri (and a bunch of other stuff) which seems counter productive to its usefulness. Battery health is 97% and never had issues, barely ever thought about battery consumption and now it's all I think about, often deciding to not even use the phone because of battery drain concerns. It feels like my amazing awesome phone was taken from me.

Long story short, is there something I'm missing with this update, something spectacular I've overlooked to offset my overall disappointment with updating? Is Apple able to revert my phone back to 13.7? I went from loving my phone to hating it in a matter of days, just kind of bummed out.",iphone

Apple plans iPhone 13 Mini launch despite poor sales of iPhone 12 Mini,,iphone
I just switched to a 12 mini after my SE2020 broke,"And holy hell is this little guy great! 
My experience so far:

1.	7 hrs usage with 30% battery left (on wifi with 2 sims)
2.	Moved from Touch ID after 7 years and damm is Face ID seamless.. well.. until wearing a mask anyways and i had to drop to a numeric pin thanks to that. I hope we’ll be out of this hell soon enough
3.	Love the footprint which is smaller than a 7,8 or SE2020
4.	Love that OLED with a surprising lack of smearing... something i hated with the original motoX (my only experience with an OLED)
5.	Not having to press a button so many times is awesome

"I Built Sepnia, calendar where you can manage your event, task and routine which featured by MacRumors.","Hello r/iphone,

Despite there are already numerous options to choose from when it comes to calendar apps (and ever increasing one too it seems), I was yet to find one app that can tick all the boxes of my scheduling needs. Some that almost do seem too jam-packed with features that in the in the end it gets in the way of scheduling process and make it feel clunky to use. Starting from this frustration I decided to build one myself and after 2.5 years in the making, I think I’m finally ready to share this project with you guys.

Since the very beginning of development I know that I want to focus on speed and clean UI. Here’s some examples of how these two reflected on the design of the apps:

* User can easily create event and input the name of the event directly in calendar. No need to open more windows just to type an event name.
* In calendar view, instead of long press, user only need to tap the event to move or change date which make schedule process faster
* Also there are features that I call “Board” that can be accessed by swipe up the shelves which contains your tasks and routines for the day. So it keeps all of these hidden and when you need it, it’s only one swipe away.

Other than the usual scheduled events, there are also **Task** and **Routine**:

**Task:** you can also add subtask and set the start date of task.

**Routine:** with routine you can create recurring task that not only based on what specific day but also specific day period (morning, afternoon, evening) which I find very helpful since before I always find myself needed to record recurring daily task which usually end up cluttering my todo list or risk being missed if not recorder. I hope routine can solve this problem, ability to organize

Other than what I mentioned above there are many exciting features that will come in the future. I can’t wait to hear what you guys think

My serial number was stolen. Has this happened to anyone else?,"I went in to the Apple store today in order to get my iPhone X battery replaced and I was told that the serial number of my phone is incorrect. I bought the phone from the Apple store and I’ve never taken it into anywhere to get fixed until today. It’s a bit of an odd situation. 

Apparently some people can generate serial numbers to put into other (I guess fake) phones in order to get replacements from the store. As such, my phone no longer exists as another phone with the same serial number was already replaced. 

Because of this they can’t do the battery replacement in my phone and I have to call the Apple care line on Monday to try and get it sorted. Has this ever happened to anyone else? Were there any lasting implications from it?

My Brand New iPhone 11 was Recovered One Year After it’s Theft!,"In March of last year, my vehicle was broken into and my brand new 11 was stolen (along with other things). The next morning I clued in to mark it as lost in the Find My app. Lo and behold, last night I got an email saying it had turned up. I thought it was a scam email, and only went in to the  Find My app this morning. Sure enough, it pinged on a house an hour away.

I called the local police, explained the situation and gave them my police report number. An awesome Deputy drove to the location immediately and in under an hour, he’s got it in custody, and I can go pick it up!

I’m so thankful for this feature that, frankly, I’ve never had to use before. People, make sure you have this feature turned on, and activate it should you ever lose your phone.

Thank you Apple, and thank you Deputy O!

Edit/Update: Phone pinged Monday, Tuesday was when the police went and retrieved it. Had planned to go collect it today, Thursday, but learned I need an appointment with the Property Office. I’ve left a message and am awaiting a call back. At this point I’m figuring it could be next week before I can pick it up. Will definitely be letting you all know when that happens! Also, I’ve been enjoying reading all of your stories of lost and found devices. Cheers, Apple people!",iphone

Anyone else switch back to 8 plus from 12Pro?,"Essentially, switching to a face ID device in the midst of a pandemic has been making me crazy. 

I bought a 12 Pro mostly for the camera and 256 storage. I continue to be delighted with the camera, however, everything about using face ID while wearing a mask has been a giant pain in the ass. From the clumsy mobile payments, to routine functions that now require two, or three steps, having to click multiple buttons and type passcodes, or remove my mask is a deal breaker. 

I just stuffed my SIM back into my trusty old 8 plus and expect to be using it happily for several months, or until I can use it without a mask.

Thank god for express replacement,"So I got my iPhone 12 Pro back in December after only ever owning android phones.

Because the phone is so nice I made the stupid decision to not put a case on it, I ended up dropping it and cracking the back glass, but I made a less stupid decision 2 weeks prior to that by buying apple care plus.

I contacted apple and asked for an express replacement because I’m unable to be without a phone because of work. They put a temporary charge on my account for £999 (the value of the phone) that would be released once I sent my broken phone back. I sent the phone back with the return packaging and label they provided and today they released the £999 (even though it still says they are still awaiting return of the original device which is strange, if someone knows why that would be great)

But yeah overall a really slick customer service experience. But I’ve most definitely learnt my lesson and will be using a case at all times :P",iphone

I'm thinking of moving from Android to the iPhone. Looking for opinions on how the 2016 iPhone SE holds up nowadays.,"Hi everyone!

I'm currently an unhappy Android user, and have been pretty much since my adoption of Android.

I've never owned any iPhones, so I have pretty much zero experience with iOS.I was formerly a Symbian user, even before touchscreen smartphones were a thing, and after that ship sailed I went to Windows Phone.

I was very happy during my time with WP. Went through three phones. Always snappy, never hang, never let me waiting for pictures to ""process"".

After that ship sail-- I mean - sank -, I went with Android. Bought myself a Motorola One a few months after launch, back in January 2019.

The messy Android UI took me a while to get used to, but the thing was not as bad as I thought it would be. At least not until Android 10 came around.

A lot of things about it drive me insane. The lack of consistency between Google's own system and apps, the messy menus, the horrible performance.It makes me want to bang my head against the wall that a device with 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage and an 8-core processor feels this absurdly sluggish.

With Android 11 around the corner, I'm afraid this thing is going to end up meeting a wall or the floor with some force.

I've been looking at the 128GB iPhone SE from 2016. For the kind of money used Motorola Ones' are going for, I could sell this dumpster fire to another tortured soul and get an SE for about $80 (plus the Motorola money, of course).

**So here's the actual question:** How does it perform these days? Is it okay for daily use?I don't ask much from a phone, really. I use computers much more than my phone. All I do is the occasional Instagramming, snapping car pics, texting, calling, and a little Youtube on the go.

Thanks!

**TL;DR:** *Android sucks. Never had an iPhone. Low on cash. 2016 iPhone SE 128GB still a good daily?*

\-------------

**Update:** *Why not an iPhone X(r / s)?*

I'm in Brazil. Those are way out of what I could pay for right now.  


* A used 64GB iPhone X goes for about US$530. (I'd rather have at least 128GB, but the X only comes in 64 or 256, so I'm using the 64GB model for comparison)
* 128GB XR \~US$590
* A 128GB iPhone SE 2016 goes for about US$220
* My Motorola would fetch about US$140\~150 used

Headphone Safety feature is too rigid,"I own the Isotunes 2.0 Bluetooth earbuds because I work in a manufacturing plant that is constantly at a 90+ decibel level, exceeding OSHA regulations. The foam tips on my earbuds isolate sound -27 decibels and as far as I can tell, actually block more sound than the 3M foam plugs that are available on the plant floor. Additionally — these eat buds are volume capped, meaning that you cannot turn them up to unsafe levels. So max volume therefore is much quieter on my BT set than would be through other Bluetooth ear buds.

Which gets me to my gripe — at least once or twice a day my iPhone is turning down the volume for me, thinking that I am sending some insane amount of volume to my ears when really I’m not. Amd there is absolutely no way to disable this, no way (currently) for the phone to recognize that my ear buds are already throttled which I think would be ideal.

Would love for Apple to have a list of headphones like these where the enforcement isn’t so stringent.",iphone

iOS 14 on iPhone XR,"Has anyone else had ANY issues with iOS 14 on the iPhone XR? 

I have had so many at this point, it's just starting to get ridiculous, and it's all started since I upgraded. 

First, I'd have a search issue. Basically, if I swiped down from the top to open Spotlight Search, it would just freeze mid-animation. It'd stay that way for the entire boot too, only way to fix it was to restart my iPhone.

Next, I'd have lockscreen issues. Basically, I'd be on my lockscreen, and the phone would just freeze there, it wouldn't unlock. Only way to fix was again, to restart.

Finally, this just happened this morning too, my iPhone just totally froze itself. Lockscreen worked fine, but that was all. It was stuck in an app (It was Plex, but it showed a frozen frame of the animation it makes mid-opening), and that's all I could see. I tried restarting it like normal, nope, didn't work, nothing came up. I even accidentally called 911 trying to force restart it (luckily nothing came of that). I finally got it restarted, and since then, have had no issues, but seriously, what is going on Apple?

It feels like I'm in a beta (which I'm not, I'm on the official stable release of iOS 14). I've been sick of Apple for a while (mainly due to their hugely restrictive practices, like Apple, I'm not 2. If I want to download an app from somewhere but the app store, I should be allowed to) but this draws the line for me. Not to mention, that my phone has a sort-of white glair on it on the screen. It's had it for a while, and I only got the phone last year, it's an issue I've never seen or had before, but it's very annoying. I'm seriously looking at buying a Samsung Galaxy S21. 

Was this version of iOS QA tested at all? Like, I seriously want to know. Especially with the whole ""Asian"" parental controls issue, did anyone at Apple properly test iOS 14, at all? I seriously have to wonder. 

I've been using iPhones my entire life, but I'm about to draw the line, this is just ridiculous.",iphone
Opinions about portless iPhone?,"Hey,

I just wanted to ask how you feel about iPhones maybe going portless in the next years.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure it would improve water resistance and the looks of the phone and maybe even security, but that's about all the advantages I can think of. 

When it comes to the negative aspects there are few more important.

First off you could only charge your Phone wirelessly. Qi or Magsafe chargers are both more expensive than cables and by far not as efficient. This could be important when you want to use your phone in your car. There the heat generated by wireless charging adds even more to the heat of the sun, high screen brightness and apps that might heat up your phone. Yes, you could place it in front of a vent, but then there would still be a large portion of the back be covered by the charger.

Besides converting about 40% of charging power into heat there is also the problem of data transfer.

I'm sure Apple will think of an AirDrop like way to sync multiple files more efficiently between Macs and iPhones, however for some cases you still need a wired connection. 

For example the only Apple device I can think of without a data port is the HomePod; I have seen a lot of posts about HomePods being unusable after a (failed) update. That was corrected in some way by Apple with giving people the opportunity to update and restore a HomePod Mini with its USBC cable on a Mac.  Even the Apple Watch has a hidden data port in case something goes wrong with updates.

I don't know about you, but in the past years there were a couple of times I had to reinstall iOS on my iPhone and iPad with a Mac due to OTA updates messing things up really bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

This leads me to a speculation that Apple will not ditch the port, but replace lightning.

Maybe a combination of Magsafe and SmartConnector that would look like the SmartConnector on iPads, on the same spot lightning used to be while allowing for data transfer. That way you wouldn't have a port where dust and water could get in, while also looking better than a hole on between speaker and microphone. Being held together by magnets would also mean that you don't have to scratch the steel if you try to plug your phone in in the dark.  And I don't think that it would be very difficult since last years iPhones already got rid of rounded corners that would have prevented a connector like this.

What are your thoughts on this?",iphone

Question on RSA Token app,"Hi - my employer is strongly pushing for me to switch from my RSA Hard Token to the soft token App through my personal iPhone. 

I logged onto the App Store and read the reviews...which gave me pause. Seems to be mixed at best, with a lot of problems for people that have iOS 14.x. 

Since I need an RSA token code to log into pretty much everything except my email while remote, I wanted to get others' feedback on the app before deciding to make the switch. Not so much on UI or if the app is pretty, but really **does the app work reliably**? I cannot afford to have any unplanned downtime, especially due to technology issues beyond my control.

iOS / watchOS Health widgets / complications - Testers wanted,"Hey guys,

I've been working on an app that basically gives you widgets for iOS and complications for watchOS to display several data from the Health app (since there was I didn't find a satisfying solution for that). 

I made a handful of compact widgets, and quite a lot complications, for every watch face position available, with multiple data points (weight, kcal burned, kcal eaten, nutritional values, water etc.). Data is fetched directly from the Health app, so you will need to grant permissions for it to work. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Example widgets \/ complications](https://preview.redd.it/5mkr9jdmalf61.png?width=1647&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14dd8d0de2bf77b9b1384c19257e824a2a2be2ca)

I want to put the app on the App Store, but would really appreciate some people checking it first (maybe some people like the idea of these widgets).

So, if you are interested in testing, you will need to install the Testflight app and send me your Apple ID (necessary for testing with Testflight).

iPhone SE (Plus) Wish: take a page out of the Google Pixel playbook,"I am still using my iPhone 7 as a daily driver and slowly but surely its time to upgrade. I've tried the Google Pixel 5 for a while, but I couldn't quite get on board with Android. Since then I've been comparing what Apple is currently offering, including 12 (Mini), 11, XR and SE. None of them hit the sweet spot completely and with the vague rumours of an SE Plus for later this year, I wish Apple followed some of the underlying choices Google made in this year's lineup. 

The P5 is powerful *enough*, compact and light but with a reasonably big screen, comes with decent storage and a good camera, is reasonably priced (in Europe) and above all has great battery life. 

The iPhone 12 is amazing and you pay for it, the Mini lacks the battery life, the 11 and XR are massive and heavy. The SE hits many boxes, but battery life and screen are just sub par. 

For me, the ideal SE (plus) would be somewhere between 12 and Mini for size with all-screen display,  by all means use an A13, dual camera would be nice but single is fine, TouchID rather than FaceID, plastic back instead of glass to keep price and weight down and make the battery as big as possible. 

I know there are people out there who play games and need as much power as possible. I don't think that should be the SE's target demographic. What I want is a phone that's great for calls and messaging, for music, taking pictures, browsing and navigation on the go. I don't want a phone that gives me the absolute latest features, I want an iPhone I can rely on easily for a day or more of moderate to heavy use in a compact and light frame.

[Discussion] The Pro Models of the iPhone NEEDS more distinct “PRO” features: both thru Hardware &amp; Software. Not JUST the CAMERA 📸 aspect but also screen &amp; touch (for example: bringing back the 3D TOUCH on the just the Pro models?) 📱,"Right now, the Pro models aren’t that much Professional. In my opinion. Calling it a “Pro” would mean that the computer is Pro is lots of levels. Not just on 1 thing: camera upgrades. 📸

WHAT IF IPHONES BRING 3D TOUCH BACK ON THE JUST THE PRO MODELS? 🤔🧐😍

I would upgrade my phone in an instant. NOW that’s a clear distinct feature that’s available only on the Pro models. And as Apple adopts this. I would love to see more DIFFERENTIATION between the Pros and the Mini’s for example — as the years go by! More extra features included there.

Whilst I love the “professional” aspect on the Cameras for the Pro Series: Thru LiDars / Tripe Camera System / Sensor Shift / extra software UI’s. There has been rumours that the Sensor Shift along w the LiDar sensors are coming across all the iPhone 13 (or 12S) models. Not just the Pros. So how can it become distinctively be called a “PRO”?

Just a bigger screen isn’t a “Pro”. Pro features are supposed to be professional features. Both thru software and hardware upgrades.

What really drove me across the roof was I have a 7 Plus. My girl just got the 11 Pro a few weeks back. I was trying to use the phone during the weekend and OH MY: I was turned OFF. WHY? MAINLY: the lack of 3D Touch. Whilst I loved the upgraded Camera: I have. MOMENT LENS that gave me Ultra-Wide Cameras for a while. But, not having to put in on every time was great! And that was it. Like the camera app / functionality is the ONLY PRO FEATURE. No screen upgrades, no buttons upgrades. Not even extra app icons that can be EASILY placed on the Pro Max models w all that extra space! No nothing else. 

It felt like I was handed an off-brand iPhone. No joke. I didn’t realize how used to 3D Touch I had become ever since 2017 (4-ish years). I was like this is so weird. I was trying to type. And I hard pressed on the keyboard to move around: nothing! I hard pressed on the  apps: yuck. No instantaneous menu. Everything felt weaker.

So it got my thinking!!! 3D Touch was like the Right Hand Click for fingers and they literally removed what would have been a revolutionary tech just because people didn’t use it as much? That’s NOT the way to go. If you expanded more on it (make those pop-up that iPhones/iPad does whenever there are new features get announced like under their : “What’s New In this Version” type of thing) on each app, then perhaps it would have gotten more people used to 3D Touch features.

What do you guys think. I would love your inputs on this.",iphone

Has Apple's glass gotten worse or am I just crazy?,"Since early 2018 I've used an iPhone X and since 2017 I've been using the Apple Watch Series 1. This was until recently when I upgraded to the 12 mini and AW S6. Not even half a year into owning both of these new devices they have scratches on them. 

On the iPhone X and AW S1 I didn't have a single scratch on either. This made me think quite highly of Apple's build quality and the glass that they used. So, going into the 12 mini and the S6 I didn't pay any attention into changing my my use habits and taking more care of them because the older items I used held up so well.

Im not sure if this is useful information but I got the Series 6 watch as soon as it came out because it came in Product(Red) finally and I got the 12 mini about 2 weeks after it was announced. Maybe I'm just crazy and I've been wildly more rough on these devices than I used to but I think theres something up with the new glass they are using.

iPhone 13 Lightning port,"I am writing this post hoping that someone from Apple is tracking this subreddit. I am fully aware that if the decision to remove the port is final nothing can change that but...

1. Apple needs to provide a solution to charging. Over the years I have accumulate so many charging cables so now I have one in my living room, one in my home desk, one in my backpack, one in office desk (when we eventually go back) etc. so I don't have to worry did I get the cable with me? With the wireless charging only it will take years to accumulate the same amount of cables. Yes, wireless is the future that's why a transition period of many years is required.
2. Apple needs to provide a solution to earbuds. I have airpods and I love them but I always have a spare of earbuds on my home, office and backpack. I remember when I was travelling I was always using earbuds because airpods need to be charged, battery life deteriorates with time and make them less useful in flights more than 3-4 hours. Moreover, for those of you who are used to listening to your favorite music or podcast before sleeping is better to use earbuds that you have so many lying around the house rather than the more expensive airpods

The reason I have some many cables and earbuds, as many of you I can imagine, is because both of them were packed together with the device (iPhone or iPad) and they last for many years (kudos to Apple's quality control). Don't forget that this the reason Apple cited to get rid of the charger, you have so many in your house already. So until consumers accumulate gradually both wireless cables and airpods is better for Apple to keep the port.

Android Or iPhone? Why Not Both?!,"Back in the day when HTC released the stunning HTC Desire HD with a metal case and at the time huge 4.3"" display, this filled my smartphone aspirations for both aesthetic and customisation.

It wasn't until Apple released the iPhone 6 and plus models did this perfect world of aesthetic, size and customisation on my smart phone choice become more frustrating.

Ever since then, have been torn between Android phones one day and iPhone the next.  
Over the years I must have switched, sold, swapped between iPhone and Android devices 10+ times at least!

Fast forward to today and the struggle still persists, my latest swap was to part with my 11 Pro max for a Samsung Note20 Ultra 5g, then back to 11 Pro Max, and then back to a  Samsung S20 Ultra 5G all within a few months.

This was costing me big in both replacement cases, cables etc as the swaps become more frequent.  
That is until earlier today when I thought, sod this, and purchased an iPhone 12 Pro Max.

I now have both the iPhone and Android and breathed a huge sigh of relief that my endless deliberating and swapping days are over!

Similarly with geotagging options for it to change levels on its own if it realizes where I am ... i.e. at home,work,school etc. 

I know Apple doesn’t usually play as nice with 3rd parties that don’t prioritize them, and geotagging sounds could be invasive/ a bigger step etc. but thought it would be good to have that level of functionality built in.

If you're like me and your car has incompatible vents for any vent mounts, and also no flat surfaces on your dashboard (like my Ford Fiesta here) I was able to use the clamp from my old [Exogear](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G024X32/) mount and attach the [ESR HaloLock](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HNBHSQV/) without any problems.  It is not an official MagSafe product though, so you won't see the ring animation nor hear the MagSafe sound, but it does work. Charging is capped at 7.5w I believe, but that's fine for me.

"let's suppose apple makes a portless iphone this year, what will you do?","will you ditch iphone and jump on the android train? or do you see a portless phone as a positive thing? 

i personally am against the idea, but it would be interesting to see what other people have to say about it... do you support the idea of apple's wireless future? or do hate the idea?

i'm personally against it because wireless charging heats up and degrades batteries faster, you cant use the phone while wireless charging because it would heat up the phone even more, and the magsafe charger is too weak to hold onto the phone while its charging... atleast for my liking 

i wont be able to use any of my wired headphones, would have to get a bluetooth transmitter to use them all, and deal with the latency... and a transmitter is another thing to keep charged.. all my powerbanks and adapters would be rendered useless, 

i know wireless charging powerbanks exist, but you have to stick them the the back of the phone and carry its weight when using the phone

Thoughts on portless iphone?,"Now I don’t know if someone has already asked this but, 

What do y’all think about the rumors of at least one phone being portless for the 13 lineup. 

Good idea? Stupid? Highly likely? How long until Samsung goes portless after mocking Apple if Apple does indeed go portless? 

Personally I think it’s a strong possibility that Apple goes portless. I don’t necessarily think it would be iPhone 13 most likely iPhone 14 or 15 in my opinion. 
I think I’d rather have the option of the port. Let me know what y’all think.",iphone
Why can’t we change the color of the status bar and or the contained notifications?

Using iPhone infrared night vision to scare our friends,"Last month we launched our LiDAR Night Vision ([https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1544262327](https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1544262327)) app right here on r/iphone. We had some really great feedback and interactions, including many comments about how the app felt like “predator vision”, was “nightmare fuel”, and how great it would be to use it to scare someone.

So, we decided to give you what you asked for. We pushed a new release of the app that includes 2 awesome features:

1. The app now works on ANY iOS Device with FaceID (iPhone X and newer)
2. We added a hidden ghost prank mode

PRANK VIDEO

Watch our video to see it in action and for tips on how to scare your friends: Secret Night Vision Prank ([https://youtu.be/dWTqLhesa3U](https://youtu.be/dWTqLhesa3U))

HOW YOU CAN TRY IT

Like and good jump scare, the setup is critical:

1. Find a victim
2. Open the app, make sure your volume up is up
3. Turn off the lights
4. Explain it sees things even your eyes can’t, as you scan around the room
5. Try to have 6ft of space behind you in the room, as this will help what comes next
6. Claw with 3 fingers slowly down the screen (you’ll know it worked when your app starts recording.
7. Enjoy!

Try this out a few times alone, so you get the hang of the setup. There is no instruction or UI in the app, so you can keep this easter egg under wraps. 

We hope you have fun scaring the crap out of your friends. If you really build into the setup- you can have some great success. We’ve had a couple adults nearly in tears. Kids… Well, we maybe shouldn’t have ruined that one 7 year olds night… 

We’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback. Have fun!

iPhone 13,"Prediction. 

The XS series introduced the XR, the most ambitious in terms of color since the failed 5c of yore.  Obviously, the XR came in Black and White, but more importantly came in Red, Orange, Yellow, and Blue.  This may be a bit of a stretch, but the warm colors shared more than temperature: they were, as a whole, darker colors.  The Orange was more vermillion than it was yellow, the yellow was visibly darker than its 11 counterpart, and even the Product Red was much darker than the 12 series released this year.  

So basically, the odd one out was blue with its extremely light color.  In addition, the “pro” or “S” series had no color that wasn’t monochrome.  

Fast forward to the 11 series.  The biggest change to the color palate of this release was the addition of green.  Not only was the “already established as colorful” base model added a green hue, so too was the “pro” series, albeit a monochrome one.  This was an (although spelled out in leaks) extremely unexpected move on Apple’s part, as the Pro series of any of their previous phones had been monochromatic.  

Now, the iPhone 12 launch was similar to the 11s in one main (relevant) way: a color was added not only to the base model, but also to the Pros: blue.  Because these colors are both cool colors in sequence, my theory (and desperate hope) is that purple will make a return on the 2021 iPhone, not only on the base models but on the Pro models as well.  The blue skipped a generation before gracing both models, and although the color underwent a tonal shift during that time, it was to a hue matching the theme of the warm colors of the XR launch.  

Not only do I think that a purple with the same mood as the green on the 11 pros, or the blue on the 12 pros would be sick, I also think that the return of purple to the base models will come with a deep hue not different from the color of the iPhone 12 that released this year.

Tl:dr - I predict there will be a Purple iPhone 13 Pro next year because of existing trends in the color scheme of the iPhone over the past few years

One of the things that always frustrated me with the note 10 was I could almost never get a decent shot of a dog with indoor lighting. Everything would always just get so smoothed out and blurry. 
Portrait mode on the note indoors also always left me wishing for something better, even with people.

Lowest price for iPhone 12 without altering our existing service plan?,"My mom and I are ready to replace our AT&amp;T iPhone 6s's with iPhone 12's (128gb), and are shopping around for the lowest price.

We have a sweetheart service plan from AT&amp;T for our iPhones (only $85/month plus fees for 9GB of shared data).

The best offer I found through AT&amp;T is $350 trade-in value and $60 discount for each iPhone 6s, **BUT** that would require us to upgrade our line to $120/month plus fees. By the end of Year 1, we'll have already paid more than just buying it outright elsewhere.

The lowest straight-up price I've found is $849 up front at Apple (similar price at Best Buy). I have to believe there's a cheaper alternative.

What I'd love to find is an interest-free 24- or 30-month payment plan for a phone that I can slot right onto our existing AT&amp;T service plan. (At this point I've accepted that I won't get much for trading in my great-condition iPhone 6s)

"[Discussion] Apple should add the option to Toggle the Home-Bar Indicator ON-OFF, or add the ability to decrease the opacity (when idle for 5-10 sec?) for the Home Bar Under Accessibility Settings!","Talking from UI POV, the home bar always gets on the way of the content, looks gigantic and is there whether we like it or not. Especially true on the iPad. It is already integrated into out muscle-memory: to be flicking up from the bottom of the screen to go home. And now, speaking as an experienced UI designer: perhaps there should be a toggle in the Accessibility Settings on both the iPad/iPhone to have the Home Button (Bar) Indicator completely removed, and or have the Opacity of the Home Bar Indicator go all the way down to 10%-15% depending on the individual user’s choice. Or have it slowly disappear and fade as the time goes by. This new feature, if introduced would behave similar to that of an “Assistive Touch” and the “Idle Opacity” under the Accessibility tab: I still rmbr Steve Jobs removing the keyboard for touch screen, cuz it was there whether we want or not...

I have an iPad 9.7 (2018) &amp; the iPhone 11 Pro. Both of these devices have a common mechanism of going back to home – along with multi-tasking within apps – the fact that the iPads, along with the newer iPhones can both go home with an upward swipe from the bottom of the screen. But, what both of them do NOT have in common are the fact that the older iPad does have a physical home-button whereas the newer iPhone does NOT. Another thing that is not common between the two is that the iPhone has a Home Bar Indicator, whereas the iPad 9.7 does not. However, the functionality remains the same. Flick-up from the bottom of the screen and go home, or swipe left / right to switch between the apps. This new method of flicking-up to go home is so convenient and I love this new integration.

Also in a keynote from Steve Jobs – back in the day, while introducing the iPhones – he had mentioned that other phones – at that time – had this full-on physical keyboard that was present there whether it was utilized OR not. But, while introducing the iPhones, Steve’s team solved that problem with bringing this full-on touch-screen hardware that replaced something outdated. Since the touch-screen CAN BE TURNED into a keyboard, or a video-player UI, buttons, or ANYTHING &amp; EVEYTHING: according to the needs, it never got in the way of the user’s screen. However, this new Home-Bar Indicator seems to be going exactly against what Steve had envisioned the touch-screen would do... This is not CONSISTENCY between the devices.",iphone

iPhone 12 Pro screen is really not what Apple is advertising,"Hello Reddit,

I got my iPhone 12 Pro in December and after two weeks of using the phone I noticed that it already has a few scratches on the screen. The scratches dont start straight from the edge of the screen and few of them are kinda deep. I have not dropped it and I’ve never had any other objects in the same pocket where I usually keep my phone. I cant think of anything else that could scratch the screen besides my fingers (and nails).

&amp;#x200B;

“But it’s your own fault, why did you not use screen protector?”

Well, because I bought a touch screen device that costs over 1000 euros and one could expect that it can handle normal use without scratches. Also, my older devices never had screen protectors and they did not scratch like this on a normal use. I’ve had couple of iPhones before (OG SE and iPhone 6), Oneplus and Samsung phones. Never scratched those on a daily usage. I understand that scratches or cracks may appear if I drop the phone, but that ain’t the case this time.

&amp;#x200B;

Apple also marketed these ceramic screens as “tougher than any smartphone glass and 4x better drop performance”. Straight quote from iPhone 12 Pro product overview page: “Tough is great, but we also wanted to make it scratch-resistant. So, using our dual ion-exchange process we use on the back glass, we protect against nicks, scratches, and everyday wear and tear.” So I guess I was stupid to assume that these screens would handle normal use. However even if I was using the screen protectors, that won’t erase the fact that the screens are not as good as they are advertised for customers.

&amp;#x200B;

I contacted Apple support and sent pictures and videos about my device, because I thought that screen has to be faulty. Their response was that there is nothing wrong with the device and their insurance does not cover these cosmetic damages as they called them. So I came to conclusion that there is only two options, either my device is faulty (which is not true regarding Apple) or the screens are not what they say they should be. I really have mixed feelings about the phone, camera, iOS and battery life are all superb, but the screen build quality is so poor. I really expected more from a device  especially in this price range. I googled (after noticing the scratches) about the iPhone 12 model screens scratching easily and apparently I am not the only one who has this issue.

&amp;#x200B;

How is this possible that they can advertise the screen to be better than the previous ones and claim something that is completely not true? ”iPhone already had the toughest glass in a smartphone. So to dramatically increase the durability of iPhone 12 Pro, we had to introduce an all-new material.” as they also market on the website. It’s frustrating that they just blame the customers for using the device normally. Does Apple have any responsibility on how they advertise these devices?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Bought an iPhone 12 Pro and after two weeks of basic usage the screen started to scratch. I am dissapointed that I paid over 1000 euros for a device that does not live up to the expectations. I totally understand IF I had dropped the phone or used it carelessly so the screen may crack or scratch, but that is not the case here. How can Apple advertise these products to be scratchproof and tougher than other phones if they most certainly are not?

Any sort of magnetic sticker to let a MagSafe phone attach to another object?,"So I got a new job that gave me an iPhone XR as a work phone and I already have a 12 Pro as my personal phone. 

It’s sort of cumbersome to carry two phones around but I thought of something that would be kinda cool. What if there was a magnetic case for my XR that my 12 Pro would MagSafe to in my pocket. 


Had anyone heard of such a “reverse MagSafe case” or maybe a magnetic sticker I could place on my XR’s existing case?  

I’m also kind of confused about whether what I need is a magnet or just a piece of metal.",iphone

Using the HK Variant iPhone 12 in the Philippines,"Using the HK Variant iPhone 12 in the Philippines has been great. I haven't really ran into a lot of problems or anything in my usage of my iPhone 12 HK. I got it on November 19th (thank you Shopee 11.11 (\[Asian Amazon/eBay\]). It was one of the best decisions I ever made. 

On my first day getting it I immediately put in my Globe PostPaid SIM and Smart Cellular Prepaid SIM too. I didn't run into any problems when I did no need for adding any carrier settings or anything. The way you put the two SIM cards  into the SIM tray is really different. There is a little clasp that holds in the one on the bottom and doesn't let the SIM card fall out, while the one on top sits on top same as a normal iPhone SIM card tray. 

I read here and online about how iPhones from Japan and China can't turn off the shutter sound even in silent mode. I can't speak on the Japan variant and China (Mainland and Macau) variant but the Hong Kong Variant doesn't seem to have that quirk I guess nor does it have the App permission for giving certain app WiFi access and it does have FaceTime audio I tried it calling some friends in New York. Also the Taiwan flag Emoji and Name of Taiwan is the same on my local Philippine iPhone 8 Plus variant and my friends US iPhone 12 variant. Using the HK iPhone on Philippine carriers Globe and Smart has been the same as it is on my local phone not changes really other than having the option to allow the phone to use the Carrier that has the strongest service. I haven't been able to use 5G as it isn't available in my area since I've been in the more rural areas since the start of the Pandemic but the LTe has been great fast and reliable but it drops to 3G when it rains not the iPhones fault blame the shitty cell carrier duopoly here. 

All in all I've been enjoying my iPhone 12 HK Variant in the Philippines it been great having the physical dual-SIM feature because of how hard it is to get the eSim QR things from Globe or Smart specially in the rural provincial areas but the physical tri cut ones are readily available. Battery has been great charging it from 20% to 100% usually takes around 1 hour-ish and draining the phone is surprisingly long during these times staying at home and mostly going to call on my laptop I usually don't use my phone unless it's for an OTP or Text/Call to my friends or teacher when the internet goes down, so it's usually around maybe every other day for charging. 

Face ID has been fun going from TouchID to Face ID has been interesting specially in the time of masks but it is really nice I like using it's a big upgrade but meh usefulness when I have a mask on. I can't wait to get home to New York soon and to try using HK variant and seeing how it preforms there with Cell band wise and 5G wise specially in the Adirondack/Catskill Mountains and Upstate farming New York (No, New York isn't just downstate or the City). Anyone else have a HK Variant iPhone 12 and are using it in the Philippines or New York? share your experience I would like hear how it's going :)",iphone

The iPhone 12 mini display looks so bad compared to previous iPhone &amp; iPad,"[https://imgur.com/gallery/JuJiGRn](https://imgur.com/gallery/JuJiGRn)   Bigger photos

 I noticed the iPhone 12 mini display looks off the moment I had it last year. So I got an express replacement and to my surprise there's no difference. I went Walmart and at maximum brightness can't notice too much difference between all iPhone 12 models. I contacted Apple multiple times and ""the only suggestion we have for you is to wait software update"" I was told this from November last year until this very moment. Okay so I bought a colorimeter to measure the white. Remember the perfect white should be R:G:B=50:50:50.

(Yes I bought the colorimeter because I'm mad, mad at Apple)

So here's my perfect iPhone XS display, an OLED and here's terrible 12 mini one, and iPad Pro 2018, which is an IPS

I also have measurements at maximum brightness in the attachments too, if you wondering what's the maximum brightness of those devices.

See how both Xs/ iPad (OLED/IPS) have almost perfect white while the 12 mini's green just stretched out too much.

iPhone 12 display comparison,"Hi y'all.

I bought an iPhone 12 64GB on day one from Amazon. I was aware of the display issues affecting many devices but at first, mine didn't seem to be involved.

A week ago, I noticed the flickering problem for the first time while watching IGTV in the dark ([credit tax](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CJl8IWWnMAm/)) - I checked further and realised my phone was *actually* affected.

I had a chat with an Apple specialist. He said the same thing you were told: *Apple is aware of the issue and working to fix it with a software update.* I didn't really buy it.

Since Amazon extended its returning period until the end of January for winter purchases, I seized the opportunity and initiated the return process.

Since the refund *is supposed* to be credited back in time before my next credit card statement (lol), I bought another device (iPhone 12 128GB) as soon as it came back in stock.

It arrived today and since I haven't returned the original device yet, I started comparing them.

*Note: the only difference between them is storage capacity. They both run the same iOS version (14.3) and have true tone feature and night shift turned off.*

The difference between the two is **day and night**, I would dare to say.

I tried my best to be in a pitch dark environment (I covered myself using a black blanket too) and used my dear iPhone 7 to picture them side by side (the original/**faulty** is the one **on the** **right**):

1. [Settings comparison (light mode)](https://imgur.com/rsnX115) (doesn't show well in picture, but whites look actually different)

5. [Video](https://imgur.com/yH8a29a)
6. (EDIT) [Whites comparison](https://imgur.com/eWZJ6Cx)

EDIT/personal consideration: note that *eventually* the ""faulty"" device actually adjusts itself after a while (you can see it at the end of the video) - probably some firmware/driver issues? And why the other one wasn't affected? Did Apple change hardware in a subsequent batch?

EDIT #2: I checked the serial numbers  
FAULTY: China, Chengdu (Foxconn) - early OCT 2020

NEW: China, Zhengzhou - Foxconn - late DEC 2020

EDIT #3: the issue seems *not* to be linked to any particular facility/factory or production date. Seems to be affecting more frequently older iPhones (3+ months old - but an iPhone 12 Pro from November seems to be affected too)

EDIT #4: /u/SlendyTheMan [managed](https://reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/kv1fz3/iphone_12_display_comparison/gj9n730) to have it replaced under limited warranty",iphone

Did anyone switch from something like a P30/40 Pro to an iPhone 12 and can tell about battery life?,"Hey guys, I am about to switch to an iPhone 12 from my p30 pro in July. I had an Android Phone for about 8 years now and want a change. Love the design of the new iPhone 12. So far according to my internet research the camera is definitely on paar if not better than the P30 pro camera. But I can't find any good comparison for the battery. The p30 pro has a great battery and holds up for two days very easy. I have an iPhone 8 for work (which I rarely use) but it has absolutely terrible battery life even on stand by .Ofc I compared SoT for both phones (p30p and iPhone 12) but since every body has a different usage, this isn't very representive.  So I wanted to ask if anyone here did also switch to the iPhone 12 and can provide some info how the battery holds up?",iphone

I made a free app to fix the biggest problem with Apple Wallet.,"The app is called Anycode Wallet, it allows you to scan, save, and show any barcode. I thought of the idea when I started using Apple Wallet more often I ended up forgetting my actual wallet a lot, which meant that I didn’t have my gift cards, and store loyalty cards when I needed it most, missing out on discounts and points. 

The app allows you to save any type barcode by simply scanning them, which you can’t do in Apple Wallet. You can also use the app to save boarding passes, QR codes … basically anything with a barcode.

I worked really hard on making the best barcode scanner too, it is really fast to scan (within milliseconds), and supports the widest variety of barcodes in the App Store. I would be really grateful if you could check it out, and any feedback or feature requests would be appreciated.

I watched and read dozens of buying guide advices for the iPhone 12 so none of you has to waste your time,"Hey everyone,

I'm not sure if this is interesting for anybody here, but since I made a list in excel I think I could at least share my results. I literally read and saw at least 30+ videos/articles on which screenprotector and which case you should buy.  


At first I want to mention that this was a quantitative study from me, so these are just numbers on how often which product is named. There was no qualitative verification since I don't have all these products (I mean buying 62 cases would be utterly stupid). The one source I would recommend for a somewhat qualitative review is the youtuber ""Mobile reviews eh"" since he has kind of an scientific approach to checking the stuff and is not sponsored ([cases](https://youtu.be/vlI82n9USN4) and [screenprotector](https://youtu.be/Y9aMdlaha9U))

&amp;#x200B;

So what are my findings?

  
I will just enlist the ones that were at least named 4 times for the cases and 3 times for the screen protectors, since some of the 62 cases were only named once:  


So the top cases are:

1. Apple Silicone Case - 10 times
2. Otterbox Symmetry PLUS Magsafe - 7 times
3. Mous Limitless 3.0 - 6 times
4. Nomad Rugged Case - 6 times
5. Casetify Ultra Impact - 5 times
6. Speck Presidio - 5 times
7. Zagg Gear 4 - 5 times
8. Totallee Thin Case - 5 times
9. Smartish Kung Fu Grip - 4 times
10. Mujjo Leather - 4 times
11. Peel Super Thin Case - 4 times

&amp;#x200B;

Top screenprotector:

1. Spigen GlastR EZ - 10 times
2. ESR Tempered Glass - 9 times
3. Caseology Tempered Glass - 5 times
4. Totallee Edge to Edge - 4 times
5. Zagg Glass Elite VisionGuard+ - 4 times
6. Qhog Screenprotector - 3 times
7. Otterbox Amplify Glass - 3 times
8. Olixar Screenprotector - 3 times

Thoughts on the 12 mini from a new owner,"Had a 5c back in the day, as well as a 7, X, and Xs Max as a replacement for a short bit. Used Android every so often since I'm pretty comfy with both operating systems.

\- It's super small and comfortable, reminds me of the 5c and 7 a lot in that respect, except that you don't compromise on the bezels.

\- Coming from the Xs Max, the size is suuuuper nice, I can not go back to the regular Pro/ProMax anymore.

\- Battery lasts me about the same level as my Xs max (day and a half? still really good, no complaints there)

\- Great grip with the leather case!

\- Camera is decent, the night-shot system is awesome. Went for a late night rumble with some friends the other night and I was amazed at how they had greatly improved the lighting of those shots.

\- Speakers are OK, they do the job, nothing more to say.

Overall I think it's a great little gadget, only really upgraded from the X Max because my family friend sold it to me for a fraction of the sale price. 

If you're using an X or any iPhone after the X before this year's lineup, I would say skip this one, it's an iterative upgrade if you are content with the performance of your notch-variant.",iphone

"Follow up after 3 months of iOS use (OP: Almost 10 years Android user, finally switched over to an iPhone 11 Pro.)","3 Months ago I purchased an iPhone after using Samsung phones for a long time. I made a post in here about my new adventure and some of the things that I would miss from Android and some of the things I was looking forward to in iOS. 

Here are my thoughts after 3 months of use.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I still miss from Android:**

* Always on Display. (I thought apple would introduce this on iPhone 12, with all models being OLED)
* Android Gboard keyboard (The layout, prediction and auto-correct is way better on Android)
* Chrome on Android is way better.
* Face ID is ok, I still prefer the fingerprint sensor. (Sometimes it doesn't recognize my face and brings up the pin screen and when I'm about to enter the pin it suddenly recognizes me and unlocks. Happens maybe 30% of the time)
* Still haven't found a calendar app/widget like the Samsung calendar widget. [Here is a screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/swvNstf/Screenshot-20200922-105227-One-UI-Home.jpg)
* I miss the Android notifications system. (Paired with AOD)
* File system/Folders. iOS combines all pictures from messages, whatsapp, messenger, camera, chrome downloads. I sincerely hate this. Is there a workaround to save pictures from certain apps to specific folders?

&amp;#x200B;

**Things that are better than Android:**

* Almost all the apps are better and more polished on iOS
* Even at 60hz its very smooth and no lag or stutter. (Which I used to experience on brand new Samsung phones)
* More app availability. (But still no Dark Sky in Canada)
* iMessage, My contacts use a mix of whatsapp, Messenger, and iMessages. Now I can be part of iMessage groups too.

**Things I still need help with or finding apps:**

* Well one is still the Calendar widget
* Is there a replacement for pushbullet yet? I used to send a lot of pictures from my laptop to my Android phone using pushbullet. It was so easy too. while I was browsing Reddit or something I would right click on the image and click ""send to my phone"". It would be on my phone. Is there anything like this for windows?

My biggest gripe was that I would miss the ""back"" gesture/button from Android. For the first couple of weeks It was hard to get used to not having a back button, but after three months. I only miss it like 10% of the time. I've gotten used to iOS gestures pretty easily.

One of the things I found out that hitting the power button ends the call. If I was on speaker phone, I would always hit the power button to turn off the screen on my Galaxies but I wasn't aware that on iPhones it ends the call. I thought I was dropping the calls, until it hit me lol.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I would probably stick with iPhone for now and maybe even the 13 if it has major changes.",iphone

"A long time ago, Apple iPhones used to be way behind on Android phones in terms of features &amp; having a lot of limitations. Today, they're about close with Android &amp; their iPhones are simply becoming more attractive. I'm thinking of saving my money for one.","As a long time Android user, Androids used to be on top of Apple; Customizations, wireless technology, OLED graphics, fingerprints, etc. I first used to own a Samsung Galaxy S3, then later, I bought a Samsung Galaxy S8 four years ago. Apple was very far behind Samsung &amp; the rest in terms of features as well as having a lot of limitations.

Today, Apple has just about caught up to Android on nearly everything. Their only flaws tend to be:

* Having to jump through hoops for certain 3rd party apps in which require you to jailbreak your product (especially for apps outside of the US).
* Not having a lot of customizations.
* Not having the 120 Hz ProMotion Display (though I'm positive that'll be fixed within iPhone 13 Pro/Pro Max).
* Not bringing back Touch ID or even having a fingerprint scanner.
* Not having a lot of freedom to do what you want.
* Apple Siri is terrible compared to Google Assistant.
* The iOS native keyboard leaves a lot to be desired &amp; could use a lot of work.
* No USB-C port which is the standard nowadays within most stuff now.

etc.

**But,** Apple does tend to have a lot of advantages over Android, such as the following:

* Better security &amp; privacy.
* Most apps runs better on Apple products than on Android due to being fine tuned with iOS optimization.
* Their battery life &amp; performance are excellent.
* Most of their products have great resell value than Android.
* Their camera quality is neck &amp; neck with Android.
* They always stay on top with software updates (you receive them frequently).
* They have excellent customer service.
* Their build quality on their products are good.

etc.

And IMO, I think I'm going to save my money for an iPhone 13 Pro (or Pro Max) as my first iPhone.

We just released Ekko - a shared photo frame widget that allows your friends to pictures to your home screen! (iOS 14),"A few months ago my twin brother and I came up with a cool idea for an iOS widget. We both put our current projects at the time on hold and went to work bringing it to life with every spare hour we had. Today we're releasing it!

Ekko is a **shared digital photo frame** **widget** that sits on your iOS home screen. Your friends and family can update what photos are shown in the widget, and likewise you can do so for them.   
Changes you make to the widget are 'echoed' for all members. Think of it as a little portal on your home screen that your friends can control, providing you with an ever-changing stream of your favourite moments. We've been trialling it for a couple of months now and its really fun! 

To use Ekko you first create a stream that you want your specific group of friends to share. Once they've joined you can all upload photos to the stream and they'll appear in the widget. Photos expire after 24 hours (unless they're the most recent), and you can like and comment too. There is also a gift wrapping feature where pics will appear gift wrapped on their home screen and they have to come to the app and unwrap them :)

We have lots of ideas for it going forward, so any feedback is also welcome! But before that we'd just be thrilled if any of you guys want to give it a go!

There is a premium mode for only a few dollars which just allows you to send photos to multiple streams at once and create groups of up to 30 people, but we're going to enable that for free on the first few thousand signups starting from now. 

Let us know what you think!

3.) Take one of the airpods out of your ear. This will pause the iPhone sound.

About switching,"guys, it's my first post here and i'm sorry to bother you with this but can anyone tell me about security?

i still think iPhones are overpriced and iOS does less than Android can, that the notch is still ugly, the lack of a fingerprint scanner is hard to accpet and also the lack of a back button in the OS looks something quite dated even with the gestures well established

but in the last few months I've been really scratching my brains with the way that Android manages the user's info through the apps... even with all the personal cons I've talked before, the iPhone looks way more secure and appears to play better with the user's about what is being shared, to which apps it's being shared and when it's being shared

this thought comes from a guy who has been a lifetime Android user and, although knowing how much I can do things my way into the OS, I no longer consider myself as a power user: I just want things to be done nicelly, get a further term OS support and feel safe with the company's way being the most fair possible to me to let me know how my data is being treated in the backgrounds... 

personally, I'm so tired of seeing so many ads showing up to me with things I've said or searched hours before in different apps (even with anonymous browse, I search for a sneaker in Chrome and then it shows up in a lot of ads at Instagram and other apps), it looks to me that Google plays harder in the shadows with all the data collected through the OS

that's why I've been thinking about switching, despite being a guy who never used iOS or Mac for more than 1 hour straight in my entire life haha (I learnt a lot of things through all these years being a little of a tech guy, but it will never match who really uses it in a daily basis)

I'm quitting most of my social networks and wanted to keep only the most important ones to my needs (2 maybe 3 of it), but also want to use it without being bombed with this kind of ad situation I've discribed

can you guys enlight my mind about it?",iphone

Google One and Apple,"On the fence of the switch over to the iPhone.  Been using android phones since day one.  

My question is I understand that most (if not all) Google apps work great on Apple.  How does Google photos fair?  I have it setup currently to upload my pics to save space and have purchased additional drive space to accommodate, and share with my wife as well.  She has an android and has no plans of changing any time soon.",iphone
"As a life long Android user, my next phone is going to be an iPhone. Here's why.","So I've always loved Android and never really had any problems. That was until recently, when my Huawei Mate 9 bricked, and I ""upgraded"" to a Samsung S10 Lite. It all started during set up, when I realised I had about 3 different accounts on my old phone, all spiderwebbed into some horrible mess which left me struggling to set up my new phone with everything from my old. In this process Samsung was also forcing their own account down my throat with aggressive vigour, so now I've got one of those too and I've got no idea how it ties in other than complicating things further. 

Past that, it's full of annoying bloatware from Google AND Samsung, all of which is now hidden in a folder because it can't he deleted. Where I loved a Google widget on my Huawei, I now have Bixby with no chance of changing it. If Google was the high achiever in class, Bixby is the kid at the back with glue in his mouth and his trousers on backwards. 

A month into use, my phone needed repairing. Charging and fast charging was inconsistent, and occasionally it wouldn't detect anything in the port at all. When I had it repaired (which was a joyous experience to be fair, they came to MY house and repaired under warranty) he said he found nothing wrong with it, but replaced the port anyway, which fixed the problem. I've since (about 4 mi this later) started to see the odd charging issue again. Watch this space. Wireless charging was not something I ever thought about until my port died. The fact all iPhones have our whilst it remains a premium feature on Android speaks volumes.

With this experience now, Android feels messy. If you change manufacturer, it's a totally different experience. Samsung has a lot of niggles I'm not used to. The in screen fingerprint scanner is a total step back from the dedicated scanner on the Mate 9. It's slow and unreliable, I've had to set my thumb as all three available fingerprints, and occasionally it'll still fail 5 times and lock me out. 

The camera is somehow slow. Sometimes it'll snap the shot as soon as you hit the button, other times it'll hesitate for a second, take the photo, and somehow blur it at the same time. The camera also seems complicated. Somehow it's not point and shoot. There's too many options and all of them are unreliable. When I take a photo, I spam the button as much as possible, knowing full well that out of 10 photos, I might be lucky if I get 2 or 3 that come out well.

The speakers aren't stereo. Didn't think it was a big issue at this price point until I started looking at iPhones, my wifes in particular. She has an XS Max (I think it's called) and the speakers blow mine out the water. That's a 2 year old phone which now sells for a similar price as mine.

Android is generally messy from phone to phone. Things that shouldn't change do. In the gallery now, when I open a video or plays muted, then it has two buttons, one muted speaker icon and one saying ""watch video"". They both so the same thing, unmute the video. Why?

On the face of it, my phone should blow my wife's out the water. Processor, RAM, camera, battery. Everything LOOKS better on a spec sheet for my phone. But everything WORKS better only my wifes phone. That's because nothing on mine is primarily built for my phone. It's all forced into place, just like the apps. Android apps are compatible with thousands of phones. Jack of all trades, master of none. But Apple apps are so perfectly refined, that the phone still performs better with ""lower specs"". Android phones have to compensate as it feels like they're trying to force square blocks into round holes. Apps also crash for no reason far more than they should. When I click an Amazon link in Googlevfor example, it will try open the app. It will crash the app, and Google. Good right?

All said and done, I unfortunately have 18 months left on my contract, which is horrifying, to realise I'm stuck with this phone for that long. I'm watching iPhone videos every day knowing I've made the wrong choice, and I can't wait to see what I get in the future. The SE 2020 seems perfect for me, and perhaps when it comes to getting my next contract there will be another SE out. Either way, I can't wait. Counting the days till I can move onto Iphone.

EDIT: I've found someone in my area possibly wanting to swap their brand new iPhone SE 2020 for my Samsung S10 Lite. I'm so excited!

EDIT 2: The swap went ahead and I’m now the proud owner of a black iPhone SE 2020, and I couldn’t be happier!",iphone

How to disable granting mobile data permission to apps by default?,"Hi,

I hope you would be able to help me with my question. 

I have noticed that when I install a new app some permissions, such as mobile data or background app refresh, are granted to the apps by default.

I have tried to disable the changes to that permissions from the **Settings &gt; Screen Time &gt; Content and privacy restrictions** but when disabled, it just grants the permission by default and doesn’t allow me to change it, until I re-enable the change.

One more thing that bugs me is that the mobile data permission won’t be visible until the app tries to access it at least one time, so for example if i’m on wifi and install a new app, to restrict mobile data for that app, i will need to first turn off the wifi, open the app, then go to settings and turn mobile data off.

I was wondering if there is any way to have a whitelist type permission granting, where app doesn’t have the permission until explicitly granted?",iphone

iPhone X leather folio doesn’t stay closed. Does anyone know of a good alternative?,"Pretty self explanatory. The case is nice and I love that it has auto sleep/wake but it drives me crazy that it won’t stay closed. I have a magnetic mount in my car and when the case is put on the mount, it flaps around open while I drive. It would also seem like it would be more safe from drops and less prone to screen breakage if the cover were more secure. 

Tried searching here and googling but not finding much. 

Does anyone know of an alternative to the Apple leather folio case that has a magnet that holds the case closed AND utilizes auto sleep/wake? I assume this is proprietary but third party has done a pretty good job of working around these types of things with Apple. 

I tried the Otterbox Strada. Nice case and held tight with magnets but didn't have the auto sleep/wake feature. Now using the Apple brand and am considering going back as the loose cover drives me crazy more often than not.",iphone

MagSafe Wallet Warning on Disconnect,"Hi Everyone!
After realising last weekend that all my cards are now Apple Pay compatible I set them up in the phone and went out to buy a MagSafe Wallet. I am one key away from being able to leave the house with just my phone, and left very motivated to solve that issue :)  
One thing making me anxious about the wallet is that it did under once dettach, more accuratly misalign and I cought it in a half dettached state.  
I’m using the silicone case under it and find the gripiness satisfactory, but not something that is 100%. It is a good compromise between being modular and holding onto the phone.  
I am far from a perfect human being, and would like a feature where the phone makes a distinct and loud sound to notify me the wallet has dettached. Doing it only when the phone is locked would also make a lot of sense to me. 
Interested to hear what you guys think and any positve/negative experiences from people who tried the wallet.",iphone

I no longer want a device with a display that can be filled with content to scroll through for hours; if I want to do some browsing, I’ll use my iPad.

A major flaw in a portless future: wireless does not work with VPN,"Many have said that the iPhone will drop the charging port in the future. There is a small problem that many will find to be a major flaw: you can hardly do anything wirelessly while using a VPN.

To even use things as simple as AirDrop you need to disable your VPN on both the host and the receiving end (update: may not require it on the receiver, not sure about the specifics).

Because of this, I still find that transferring files (or doing anything else) via cable to be a much more *robust* option that actually *works* all the time without my having to guess what the issue is. I mean, sure, maybe we could get by without a port. But do it's highly obnoxious discovering small issues like this which compromise the reliability with which I use my device.  It took me a *long* time to find out why my AirDrop and Sidecar weren't working half the time. I guess that's also because of Apple's strong desire in being so closed-off – you can hardly debug issues like this – but that's a different topic for a different day.

I bought 22 iPhone 12 cases,"[Photo Library Here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/temiKjkqttK6Wnfx9)

I should start off by stating that I'm just an average Joe who went a little overboard with case purchases in the past couple of months. Not a professional Youtuber/reviewer, and definitely not sponsored. 

I also bet that there are some of you out there who have gone down this rabbit hole much deeper than me. Fess up folks. 

Nontheless, I wanted to share some of my thoughts here, hopefully it helps some of you with your purchase decisions as well.

\--

# Background: 

This is my first iPhone, after a 5 year hiatus over on Android (Samsung S6, S8, Essential, Pixel 3, and a few others). They were all great, but still regard the iPhone 4S to be the best overall designed phone... ever, and a close second being a toss up between the Pixel 3, and the Essential PH-1. 

So when apple finally decided to go back to the flat, boxy designs of its glory days, I felt it was finally time to return back to the walled garden. The boxy, sharp edge design meant 2 main things: Glass Screen Protectors without compromises, and Grip-ability. 

But beyond the design, coming over from a Google Pixel back to apple also opened up a whole world of case choices. If you've ever been on the other side, you will know what I mean exactly. Finding a thin, well made case for any of the non primary brands was a real difficult task, especially if you are not based in the US.

Nontheless. Lets begin...

# Case Categories

There are 4 broad categories of cases that I purchased, and the review will follow these groupings: 

1) Leather Cases

2) Silicone/Polyurethane/Plastic Cases

3) Thin Skin Cases

4) Bumper Cases

&amp;#x200B;

# 1) Leather Cases

These are typically expensive cases, and i splurged on both the Apple Saddle Brown Case, Nomad's Rugged Case, and some more affordable alternatives from ESR.

**Apple Leather Case -** These are a great leather choice... if your priority is not leather quality. This was one of the first cases that I purchased because I longed for the same feel in hand as the older iPhone 4S and 5 Leather cases, especially the Project Red editions. Apple's leather series seemed to be pretty well known for its patina-bility, as can be seen from the various threads here, and the dedicated thread over at MacRumors. However, this year's leather type, and quality, seems to be a little different from from its past forms. It doesnt seem to patina well over time, but instead darkens easier with frequent wear.

With that said, apple gets it right on the following fronts: Slim profile, button tactility, and well... magsafe. The leather is still great dont get me wrong, but when compared to other cases in general, and especially leather cases, there is non that matches apple's button feel, given that it's also made of metal, and the overall slimness of the case.

I wouldnt, however, recommend this case if the main reason for purchase is for a durable, and well aging leather. Apple's leather case falls short on this front.

**Nomad Rugged Leather Case** \- If leather is top priority, I fall back to Nomad's Leather case series. They make overall great leather cases, and I own the same for my Pixel 3, and Airpods as well. They've aged well, and dings and marks only adds more character over time. Their materials have been altered in their latest rendition, where the case overall feels lighter, but less ""rugged"". They can also take a beating, as promised by their 10 ft drop claim. Inside the case is lined with some soft silicone material along the edges, which makes the protection claims believable. It also keeps some of the flat edge design of the iPhone 12 intact, while rounding off the corners at the back and front of the case. 

With that said, the button feel and profile of the case leaves much to be desired. The buttons feel... empty, and mushy, and just overall isnt great feeling. It is also one of the bulkiest case of my list of 22 case choices, no doubt this is by design. 

Even after a month, the leather smells great, and a nice patina is gradually developing, as the leather darkens overall.

**ESR Leather Cases** \- These are the cheaper alternatives if a leather case is a must. They look great, from afar, especially the white and rose gold one. These cases feature a few nice touches - metal buttons which add to the tactility of the case when put on, and a slim profile. The inside of the case is lined with soft cloth material. I wouldn't call it microfiber, and the buttons seem to be lined with cardboard material.

There are minor differences between colors though. While the claim is that these are made of genuine leather, the white leather feels a little more supple than the black, and they both feel really thin, almost paperlike. The pebbling of the leather also feels artificial. They are a far cry away from apple and nomad's cases, so dont expect too much from ESR on this front. The case is also a VERY tight fit on the device. No issues getting to the mute button, but putting them on and taking them off often leaves stretch marks on my phone skin, and requires you to really push in order for the case to come off.

# 2) Silicone/Polyurethane/Plastic Cases

Where do I start...

**Ringke Fusion (Matte)** \- This is a great case especially if you like the back of your phone to be visible. Ringke seems to have a few common design attributes across their iPhone 12 case line. The raised lips on all 4 corners of front of the case, and the lip around the camera bump all ensures that your phone is well protected in case of drops. I distinctly remember being pleasantly surprised when i first held the case in my hands, i though my search has come to an end, this was the End Game (obviously not the case).

The back of the case is made of matte plastic, which keeps away fingerprints, and gives a nice blur look to the phone. It is smooth and soft to the touch. The bottom cut outs arent precise, and are large enough for generally most type of charging cables, and comes with a landyard holes as well, if you so choose to go down that path. 

The buttons maintain good tactility, is close to apple's leather button feels, but is unmistakably plastic.

**Baseus Matte Case** \- These are very similar to Ringke Fusion, with a few exceptions. They do not have the raised corners on the front, and the camera bump on the back. The buttons are a lot more mushy than ringke's version.

With that said, they come in 3 nice colors - Clear, Smoke Black, and Blue (for those blue phone fans). The back of the case is also ""claimed"" to be made of glass, as opposed to the plastic back on Ringke. This difference is especially clear when taking the case off the phone, where Baseus's cases flexes much less, and cant be peeled off like Ringke's Matte Case. The matte glass back matches apple's frosted back feel in hand much closer than the frosted plastic from Ringke. Unlike Ringke though, Baseus precision milled the cutouts to match the phone, which is a nice touch

**No Brand Frosted Cases -** A dime a dozen from your choice of online retailer (Lazada, Aliexpress, Shoppee, Amazon, etc). They look, and feel, more bulky than other cases, with bright orange buttons. They are more ""soft touch"" feeling rather than matte/frosted feel, but otherwise provides equal amounts of protection to the phone. I wish these cases came without a back, as their TPU outer layer makes for a great bumper case, and the buttons are exchangeable, similar concept to Rhinoshield's bumper cases. 

**Ringke Onyx** \- I use these cases the most out of all the cases I have, mainly because they get all the basics right. Its made of flexible material that is easy to put on and off, with plastic buttons that feel right up there with apple's buttons. The outer material is really grippy and has all the drop protection features you would expect from any Ringke case (raised corners, camera protection, and 4 stoppers on the back. The design is simple, minimalistic, no nonsense, and they are really quite affordable. For an everyday beater, you cant go wrong with this case.

**SmartDevil Silicone Series** \- These are great alternatives to apple's silicone cases. Their cases do not have any branding on the outside, and is made of good quality silicone. The colors arent Neon Like... and look great from all angles. The only ding on these cases are the visible seams on the middle of the frame, and the soft mushy buttons. Given the affordable price these go for, thats to be expected. I got them in white, yellow and red, and white seems to be my overall favourite. The cutouts are also precision milled, and lines up perfectly with the phone

**Knockoff Apple Silicone Case** \- Please dont waste your time and money on these. I regret buying 3 of these

# 3) Thin Skin Cases

**Baseus Thin Cases -** There arent that many options if you would like absolute thinness in a case. Baseus makes the most affordable version of these cases, and both the smoke black and clear matte versions look great especially if you have  teardown skin on from DBrand. The fit is exact, down to the speaker cutouts, and I personally prefer a full camera cutout with the raised lip around it, instead of the other common 'hole-ly' cutouts from other manufacturers. Given its simplicity, i didnt see the need to try other brands/manufaturers for these cases since they will pretty much feel/look the same, offering no protection whatsover besides preventing scratches. Your buttons are exposed, and will feel less raised given that they line up closely with the thin case around it. 

If you absolutely hate cases, but despise apple for giving us shiny frames on the Pros, this might be a worthy compromise. 

# 4) Bumper Cases

Generic Metal/TPU bumper case - This is such an underserved category of case, even for apple. Back during the Antennagate days, this was my absolute favourite type of case. Simple, shows off the back with a nice skin, and just enough bumper to be grippy and protect the edge of the phone when laid on a table. 

Its no longer the case (pun intended) with the iPhone 12. There are barely any good options for these, besides Rhinoshield's overpriced, oversized bumpers. These ones that i found boast of good materials, while retaining all the benefits of being a bumper. The black looks much better than the silver, given that it hides all the unsightly seams around the bumper. The buttons feel great since its made of metal, and preserves the tactility of the phone, but its volume rocker is unreachable unless you have extra nails on your fingers. 

There's also minor variations between the black and silver versions of the case - the silver version has raised corners on all 4 corners of the phone, whereas the black is just a solid lip all round the back of the phone. The fronts are the same. 

# TLDR: 

If you read this far, thank you. At least I hope you enjoyed the read. If not, here's the quick summary, and my conclusions altogether: 

Favourite Leather Case - Apple Leather Case. If you are scoffing, please scroll up and read why

Favourite Transparent Case - Ringke Fusion Matte Clear

Favourite Silicone Case - SmartDevil in White

Favourite Thin Case - Get any that is cheap really...

Favourite Bumper Case - Doesnt exist yet

My Everyday Case, and overall favourite - Ringke Onyx

After months of switching cases back and forth, I really want to just go back to being totally caseless. But Apple's decision to make the sides of the Pro shiny like a mirror unfortunately makes this impossible. Maybe getting the 12 non pro would have been better.

Hope everyone finds something useful to takeaway from this post!

Apple is ghosting me after delivering me a faulty phone,"I've always been an Andriod user my whole life and wanted to try the Apple ""magic"". So I just got myself an iPhone 12 at the beginning of December. After a few weeks of use, I noticed there was a gap on the right side of my screen where I could stick a card in and it would collect dust/particles. 

I decided to contact support on 16/12/2020 to set myself a repair so I could send my phone in for examination. They told me the whole process would only take 10 business days tops from start to end.   
I was quite happy to hear that, thinking Apple would fix my issue in no time with their ""magic"". 

On the 17th or 18th a UPS driver shows up at my door and tells me to hand in my package so he could ship it back to Apple, I was a bit confused and told him that I was supposed to receive an empty box so I could put my phone and ship it in. We were pretty sure the box was just on the way to me because it has been only 1-2 business days. 

After this incident, the UPS driver shows up at my house two more times and goes back empty-handed, so I decided to contact Apple to see if everything is in order. They tell me that the box might be lost on the way to me so they cancel my repair request to create a new one, the same thing happens and the box is still a no-show. 

For the third time, I'm actually mad and really want this thing to be done, I contact the support again on 3/1/2021, after talking to two senior advisors they decide to put me on the phone with an Apple consultant and make a three-way phone call with UPS so things can be sorted out. When I get on the phone we spoke for a while and he told me to wait patiently while he talks with UPS to solve it, I thought we would have this conversation together but didn't mind, I decided to let them their business while I wait.

After their short talk (like 5 minutes or something) the consultant tells me that everything is now set and I should receive my package pretty soon, YAY! 

No, things, unfortunately, doesn't go that way, today I decided to talk with Apple support, and the answer I got actually shocked me. They told me that the third repair request wasn't a shipment but a CDO (Customer Drop Off). I was extremely shocked about this and asked to speak with a senior advisor again. The guy on the chat told me to wait for a while he connects me to the senior advisor, Nick, so I said yes and waited but Nick actually just disconnected from the chat the moment he was connected. I decided to chat back and ask what happened but now I didn't have the option to chat with support. 

I decided to click the link on my mail that would get me a callback from Apple and it did. I spoke with a guy for a few minutes and he told me to wait a while and put me on hold. Everything was okay until he randomly decided to disconnect the call. After a few minutes, someone else calls me and tells me that the call was disconnected due to unknown reasons and he was there to help me. OK. 

I spoke with this guy for 20 or so minutes just for him to tell me that it's UPS's fault and not Apple's, they aren't responsible for the box they are shipping. Like what? (I've talked with the UPS driver, even got his number. He tells me that he only gets the claim order, not a delivery.) 

Anyways, sorry for my broken grammar, English isn't my first language and I'm a bit frustrated to think/write straight. Is there any possible way that I can get this to higher-ups so I can get my phone repaired? (I live in Norway btw.)

Iphone 12 pro max frame scuffed from bottom left. Should I return it??,"Hey all,
I have been so torn for a couple of days now over whether I should return my phone or not. I got an iPhone and I even didn't take it outside the house and in 2 days or 3 I saw 2 nicks exposing the steel frame on the bottom left of the screen. Those are seen when looking closely from certain angles.
 I have absolutely no idea how they got there.
I am considering returning it for an exchange, given that exchange is eligible, should I care about it as I am worried that the replacement unit will have its own set of issues.
P.S. guys I know its my phone and I get to call it, but I want to take insights from you guys and if anyone has experienced it before.

I am financing the device on 2 year contract anyways so in those 2 years I am.expecting those of course its just so frustrating carrying a brand new phone knowing those nicks and scuffs are there.",iphone
iOS is unreliable and the Apple ecosystem is bad,"I have never hated Apple so much in my life and I want to share my experience. #rant

Tuesday night my iPhone XS Max was working fine. Yesterday morning I woke up, I opened WhatsApp and it complained that it was running out of storage.  
That's strange, I checked my storage last week and it was only half full of 256GB. I opened Settings to go and check the storage and the App was crashing.  
I tried twice and had the same problem. In the meantime, no messages from iOS saying that I was running low on storage. I doubt that in 1 night I downloaded somehow more than 100GB.  
I made the mistake of restarting the phone and I ended in a boot loop (or Apple logo loop). No way of exiting it.  
I had to put the phone in restore mode and tried the reinstallation of iOS (Update option) from a PC using iTunes but it was getting stuck on Error 14.  
I started my journey in contacting Apple support via chat. First I stayed online with an advisor 2 hours just to repeat myself over and over again with the steps I already tried.  
Finally she understood that she had to pass the case to a Senior Advisor that, after reading the entire chat for almost 30 minutes, only booked a phone call for me.  
I was called just to be put on hold. Finally they picked up the phone and the advisor wanted to hear everything again from me, even if I was told by the previous advisor that he was going to leave all the notes and the person calling me would have been up to date.  
His only solution: send it for repair. Unfortunately we are in lockdown and Apple Stores are closed so the only way would be to send it via mail to an Authorised reseller.  
While on the phone, he also sent me the link via email:  
https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT211981  
where it clearly states:

&amp;#x200B;

If your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch was running iOS 13 and was low on storage before you tried to update, you may experience one of these things:

Published Date: December 16, 2020  


I already explained many times that my phone was on iOS 14.3 and the Update I was doing from iTunes was then from iOS 14.3 to iOS 14.3.  
The advisor said that it shouldn't matter on the iOS version so I complained that whoever reviewed that documentation page left intentionally iOS 13.  
Given that the call was inconclusive, I ended the conversation. He even asked if I was happy with the Apple support received. Funny.

In the meantime I checked icloud.com to understand when was the last backup that the phone did to iCloud.  
""Yesterday at 12:54 AM"", meaning that I had to lose more than 24H of data.

I decided to try again to reinstall iOS (Update option) but using a macOS Catalina instead.  
I let it download iOS and then I paid extreme attention to click ""Update"" and not ""Restore"", as I didn't want to lose any data.  
I saw the progress bar on the phone going on and I was very happy until on macOS I read ""Your iPhone has been restored to Factory Settings"".  
WTF! Why did you do that?! I'm even using a product from the Apple ecosystem! I was very upset as I lost all the data

I decided to try the restore from iCloud. Guess what? The last backup available was from Monday at around 16:30. Why then was icloud.com showing me something different?! Even their systems are not reliable!  
I'm paying £2.99 per month to have a reliable backup and now I have to lose 2 days of data. We are in a lockdown and I'm always at home, meaning that the phone is always on WiFi, most of the time with battery &gt;50% and the screen is locked when not used.  
Why wasn't iOS backing it up to iCloud?

It tooks hours to restore from that backup and of course the Storage utilization shows that I'm not even at 50% of storage capacity.

My takeaways are:  
1) The documentation is unreliable, saying that Error 14 was related only to iOS 13, or the advisor was lying  
2) iOS can't be considered a reliable operating system if it can't run when low on storage. Shouldn't it reserve some storage just to run properly and let users delete stuff?  
From my experience with Android, you can't save anything else but Android still runs.  
I had exactly the same problem with my brother's iPhone when it stopped booting and ended with the same problem.  
3) Apple support is incompetent at so many levels. They should get better training and they should have some tools to let users unlock iPhones in these situations.  
I just needed to either get access to iOS to delete some stuff or connect the iPhone to a PC and access its storage so I could move some photos/videos.  
It's not rocket science.  
4) macOS gives misleading information and erased everything without my consent  
5) Information on icloud.com is not reliable

And (almost) all of this happened on an Apple ecosystem!",iphone

iPhone 12 Pro Max 🔋 battery status after two months of use,"Hey folks, 

I am a happy/lucky owner of the 12 Pro Max. I ordered the iPhone right after the pre-order was available and received it already one week later. At the beginning, I was thrilled with the battery life. In the meantime, I am a bit shocked. With normal use (screen time on weekdays at 4h, on weekends at 5-6h max), the battery barely lasts longer than 10-12h. Background refresh is completely disabled and location is only allowed for certain apps when in use. 
What shocked me even more: Meanwhile, the battery status in the settings also dropped to 99% after just two monts.
Has anyone here had similar experiences or tips to improve the runtime? 

Currently, I am considering contacting support or buying Apple Care+ if the battery status continues to be so stressed. I would still have 8 days left to place the order. 

I am curious about your input and apologize for my English - greetings from Germany.

How is RAM different on iPhone compared to Android ? (on the edge between 12 and 12 Pro),"Hi guys, so I'm a long time Android user and I decided to make switch to iOS. Nothing bad to say about Android but I like to explore my options and this would be my first time using the iOS so I'm excited to try it. 

I'm kinda on the fence between the 12 and 12 Pro but my main concern is the RAM. Currently I'm using a 2 year old Android phone who also has 4 GB of RAM and I noticed that it is a little bit slow when I multitask, and for some reason it takes longer to open some apps, messenger got laggy etc. I don't know if this is the software, old phone, or just lack of RAM but its certainly annoying when I need to jump between messenger and some apps and its pretty slow or it randomly reloads. 

So my question is, is the situation better on iPhone even tho its the same RAM size ? Does the iOS have better RAM management ? Where I come from the price for the Pro is a lot higher then regular 12 so its not a big deal for me to lose lidar and a third camera but the RAM is the biggest concern. Also are there any more things that make the pro more worth it then the regular 12 ? I am a casual social media user, camera is also an important factor but from what I heard you won't really notice the difference unless you are a pro photographer.",iphone

If Apple truly does remove any form of a charging/data port on their phones how would we go about connecting it to our computers to back them up?,"I may be speaking for the minority of users here, but since I’ve used an iPhone I have always connected it to my computer for backing up and updating.  If Apple removes the lightning port like all of the big tech youtubers think they will - are they just expecting you to not be able to backup (the phone but also more importantly photos), restore and/or update your phone safely?  Not that it happens frequently, but I’m sure everyone here at some point has had to connect their phone up to their computer for a factory restore.  Will that just be impossible in this future no one is asking for?  Wireless charging is cool and all, but I value protecting my expensive phone with a rugged case (that may not allow for current to pass through) far more than being able to plop my phone on a pad to have it charge.  Will Apple just expect us to go to one of their stores if there is ever an issue with your phone that requires a factory restore?",iphone

Why I finally switched from Android to iPhone after 10 years,"Sorry for the long post. Can't add TL;DR because I cant summarize it.

First of all, I’m a big Google fan and still am. I have been using Android since the Nexus One days in 2010 and have only been using Nexus/Google play edition/Pixel phones. IMO, Pixel is the only true Android phone, everything else is just junk. So, you can see although Android is diverse, I have only one option. It’s either Pixel or iPhone. Though I’d switch to iOS I’d still use some of Google's services because they are the best. iPhone with google services is a better combo. Here are the main reasons that drove me towards the iPhone.

## Efficiency

It is a known fact that iOS runs much more efficient than Android. Android OEMs usually compensate this by just adding huge batteries(30% larger). Still, they have the same or worse battery life. It comes down to how the OSes are designed from the beginning. iOS more closed and Android more open. However in recent times both seem to converge. iOS has always been strict with background processes which Android also seems to be doing off late. But Irony is Google’s own system Apps are the biggest abusers. Ever seen Gboard in your battery usage charts? It always has a background process(can be seen in Developer options-&gt;Background processes). When you install an alternative keyboard it shows up in the battery chart with high background usage! (I don't understand why some system Google apps dont show at all).

Battery life on Android is not consistent to say the least. There may be some Android phones which have better battery life than iPhones but I’m pretty sure there’d be one day when the battery just dies on you even though you didn't change anything(more about this in the next section). I’d prefer a consistent battery life to a better battery life but inconsistent.

## Google play services

This is the backbone of Android OS so much so that even though Android is open source, basically every major app is broken without these services. So, even if you install some ROM you would basically have to get these services for apps to run.

As I mentioned above, on one fine day, your phone would die in a day and the Google play services shows up in battery usage, but there is nothing much you can tell what was the actual source of the drain. I would like to have detailed information about which of the services was causing it which app was responsible for it.

Also, if you search ‘Google Play Services’ on the play store, you can't get to the listing. Only way afaik is to go to App Info-&gt;Google Play Services-&gt;App details. And one cannot disable updates for it! It can update whenever it wants.

Atleast, battery life has been very consistent with my iPad Pro. Yes, there would be some system update which has some bug and causes battery drain but it will be fixed in the following update. At least I don't have any surprising days.

## Google vs Apple

Apple is basically a Hardware company. That's where their major revenue comes from. Google on the other hand made 130B$ (81% of total revenue) from ad business alone in 2019. So, the purpose why the OSes were created is very clear. That’s why Android is designed to be open to accommodate faster adoption and it worked. Android devices upload 40 times more times more data when idle compared to iPhones. No matter how much I try to opt out of ad personalization and activity tracking, the battery usage doesn’t get better during idle.

Personally, I don't mind sharing my data to avail some free services. Infact, some of Google’s services are the best and there aren’t even any paid alternatives that come close. I also dont mind seeing a personalized ad rather than some irrelevant ad for adult diapers. But why is it necessary to collect the data when the phone is just sitting there idle. I already share my Mail, Photos data, Maps data, Chrome history etc. Why doesn't Google just collect whatever is necessary and upload it when connected to a charger?! I don't mind that. Basically, I want Android phones to be more reliable and consistent in terms of battery life.

## iOS off late is awesome

I have been using Android since 2010 from the Nexus One days. I hated iOS since the beginning. I had an iPod touch. I always felt iOS is more suitable for kids and elderly and to get any kind of productive work out of it is not possible. I also have an iPad pro since a couple of years which I was just using like a chrome book. Even till the recent times, you had to open the calendar app to see your daily agenda. On Android, you can add a widget to the home screen. Thanks to iOS finally adopting widgets. Also App drawer or the lack of it, having gazillion apps sitting on your home screen with all that clutter! I wonder how people lived with iOS all through. Thanks to recent changes in iOS 14 like widgets, app library, default apps, SHORTCUTS.

## Shortcuts

Wow, when Apple introduced it in iOS 12? I was excited because I knew having system level automation would make iOS very powerful. I’d have expected something like this on Android first. But even after two years, there is no sign of any equivalent on Android. Yes, I know Tasker, I’m a big fan and have a lot of profiles. If there is something that I don't like I can just get it to work with Tasker. The problem with Tasker is its lack of ability to easily interface with other apps and it doesn't have system level integration. Tasker is basically one main reason why I stick to Android. When I thought of giving iOS a try, I went through my Tasker profiles to see if I can implement them using shortcuts. To my surprise, most of the profiles were to optimize battery life like turning off location, BT, WiFi, enabling battery saver etc. Like I said, battery life would be terrible some day and I’d be spending that day with Tasker to find the culprit or find a way to limit usage somehow but all efforts were vain because if some system level apps are to be blamed, you can't do much. Some other profiles I could replicate using Shortcuts like showing day’s agenda and so on. I hope Apple opens Shortcuts for 3rd party developers to integrate their apps deeper and makes it much more powerful.

## Why spend &gt;700$ on an Android?

I don't understand why people spend premium(&gt;700$) on an Android! When Android devices are just uploading 40 times more data, it is your resources that are being used to send your data to Google/OEMs for its advantages. The CPU, Cellular, WiFi Antennas are just used 40x more. The hardware just degrades much faster. That’s why Android devices degrade faster. Shouldn't Google subsidize all Android phones? because they are working for them. IMO, Android is very good if you are spending 400$(Pixel 4a for e,g) but only till Apple introduces a competitive phone in this price range (iPhone SE is not bad but it is just outdated). And it is out of my mental ability to understand why people spend 1400$ on Samsung’s ~~crap~~ not so good phones.

## Google’s Priorities

There is an Android version of Shortcuts called Rules and also Assistant shortcuts. Chances you have never heard of it. They are let’s just say, very basic. Even though Assistant shortcuts was introduced almost a year ago, there's been absolutely ZERO progress ever since. No third party has implemented anything yet. Also, have you noticed how rapidly Gboard and Photos were developed in the recent past. They kept on adding features on every update. Because they are helpful in harvesting more data about users. The features which actually add value to users but have no value to Google’s business model get very less attention. That’s why I don't see Android ever getting Shortcuts’ equivalent. The past few Android releases have added nothing significant. There is immense progress in solving the Android fragmentation issue. The amount of system level and architectural changes they made at such advanced stages of OS is commendable. But they are just trying to solve an unsolvable problem(it is a side effect of opensource OS). There aren't any significant user facing changes where as iOS is just getting better and better.

Anyone not happy with their 12 Pro max?,I like big phones so I got the 12 Pro max along my Samsung Note 9 and I have to say that I am disappointed so far.

Should I update from iOS 13.6 to 14.3? Benefits vs. Drawbacks from a strictly user based perspective.,"Hoping this meets the sub guidlines. Which are a bit extensive for my general interests in the topic.

This is not a technical question, I have reviewed the new features and security page. While everything I read there says yes, I have learned from past experiences the newest version isn't always the best for user functionality. Windows 10 being the epitome of that statement.

I have always preferred android for its ability to be completely customizable with open source, privacy forward sources abound. I was given an iPhone and am enjoying the experience I have denied myself of, but am definitely missing some of the flow that a customized phone brought. Hoping I find that in a different OS. But don't wanna end up further from what I'm looking for.

In the android community a question like this usually results in leaving with the answers you sought lost in the fog of war. The soldiers battle gear being ill fitting word shirts, the crackle of gunfire being angry and frantic taps from uncut, dirty fingernails. The sound of mouth breathing and slurps of mountain dew filling the night air. 

Hoping to get some general answers without creating too much conflicting dialogue. That being said, I realize opinions aren't uniform.

"Bought a demo iPhone 12 Pro Max, what am I missing from a retail version?","So long story short, wife washed her XS in the washing machine today and when I dropped it off at the repair shop they had an ‘open box’ 12 pro max for sale. Picked it up for my wife and when I got home, saw on the box says demo, not for resale and we could download any apps. Called shop they said it’s the same phone just needs to be restored from a computer. Did that but now I’m concerned that I’m missing something... anyways they said we could use this one until a retail version came in we wanted so I said yes to that but am I missing something here?


Edit: so I called Apple and they said as long as it’s been restored to non demo firmware, I am good to go. They confirmed I have warranty coverage and the phone also indicates my coverage in the general tab.  Went back to the repair shop to pickup the repaired XS and spoke to the owner about the feelings of deception not being told it was a demo and we agreed to a further discount to cover the screen repair and I was content to keep the phone.",iphone

Iphone 12 Mini small personal review,"Hey, so I recently bought the new iPhone 12 mini, i replaced it with my two year old iPhone XS.
I just wanna say that this phone is absolutely amazing and its perfect in every way (battery could be a bit better).
I have quite big hands and still the size is perfect for me. The camera on this little thing is absolutely stunning and im honestly blown away by night mode, its so good.
So to people that is in the market for an iPhone, i can suggest this.
Now battery life is something that lots of people are talking about when it comes to the iPhone 12 mini. For me its good, better than my XS and if i really stretch it out i can probably get 6 hours of screen time on it. Yesterday i managed 5:40 hours and my usage that day was camera, social media, videos, music, lightroom photo editing, browsing internet. So yeah as everyone else say if you arent a heavy phone user this iphone 12 mini will do just fine in my opinion.

I got my iPhone 12 mini in blue and i actually went ahead and bought Apples clear case for the iPhone. I have not seen a single positive review of that case, but i didnt care and went ahead and got it for myself.
This is my subjective opinion about the clear case.
It looks amazing and you get to show off that beautiful blue color. People have complained about the buttons being too hard to press, i mean yeah they are not super easy to press, but its honestly a positive thing. Sometimes earlier when i had other cases on different phones, it would click buttons in my pocket when i pulled it in and out. It wont do that with this cover.
For me they are just fine and it feels good to press them.
Only thing id say about the cover is they got small stress marks in the bottom (not cracks). I will see how that turns out.

I really love this phone and im so happy i got it.
If you have any questions feel free to hit me up.",iphone

iPhone 12 Pro screen protector bubble,"I couldn’t find a relevant sub to post it on so I thought you guys here could help me out...

I bought the Belkin UltraGlass screen protector for the iPhone 12|12 Pro from the apple store and installed it myself.

After I installed it there were no bubbles and it was a clean fit. 2 weeks later I noticed that there was a small bubble at the bottom of the screen that appeared out of no where. I didn’t bother much then, but now its turned bigger and it keeps growing.

I don’t fidget with it, I haven’t even dropped my phone once so how is this happening, is there any way I can fix it.

I bought it for like $45 and I don’t wanna buy a new one its only been a few weeks.

Would you like a rugged iPhone?,"Buying a case for your new aluminum-glass-sandwich is pretty much the norm. I doubt people care about the actual tactile experience of a glass device anyways. If anything they probably found it annoying since it’s slippery and fragile, I know I did.

When I say rugged device it could either be a tougher version of an existing version, like the S8 Active, or built from the ground up, like the Blackview BV9500 Pro. 

Given that people put their phones in cases anyways, I know they don’t dislike the small added size and volume increase. Hell thick-ass Otterbox Defenders are a thing. And while we’re at it, can the increase in thickness also come with larger batteries.

This was an issue with the iPhone SE and iPhone 6s, models from around that period.

Peeps who got the iPhone 12 after waiting for 2 or more years to upgrade: What are your impressions?,"I have been upgrading almost every year since the iPhone 5, but I regretted getting the XS because of the minimal improvements from the X so I skipped the 11.

I usually go for the mid-sized phones but this time I went for the largest because of the rumored camera improvements. The 12 Pro Max is a great device all around device that will serve me well for 2 more years at least, and the cameras are amazing of course, but on the whole it's still not quite a revolutionary leap. MagSafe generally seems to be lackluster. I really wanted to get the wallet but it feels crap in practice (my intended use case was to quickly tap through transit gates, but apparently it blocks NFC and you can't easily take out cards without taking off the wallet first to push them up from the notch in the rear.) Looking forward to some decorative MagSafe accessories though once third-parties join in.

The biggest impediment is still the limitations of iOS. They're still not fully using the larger screen space. And other artificial restrictions like not being able to easily record a video while playing music. Or the apps that promised to let you record from all 4 cameras at once during the iPhone 11 but they're still not here (or are they?)

My 2021 iPhone Predictions,"#Naming

All leaks point towards it being named the iPhone 13, and while I don't remember name leaks ever being wrong, I still have some belief in the 12s - they've just done a huge redesign and I highly doubt a new one would take place for the third year in the row (11 had new cameras, 12 is flat so those were obvious model changes but no major redesign is expected so I believe in the 12s being possible)

#Features

1. Major improvement in the battery department. 
We've seen a significant decrese of battery life in the twelves, which is a rare occurrence, especially that 5G requires way more energy and I would assume they make it better next year. 

2. Lightining port. The USB-C on the iPhone is something we can be sure never happens, especially that they're going to remove the charging port soon anyway. But speaking of that, I am almost certain the removal won't happen in 2021 - they just released new headphones which are not MagSafe compatible and have the proprietary lightining port, and forcing users to carry two chargers for their newest AirPods and their newest iPhone which only came out 9 months apart would be too un-Apple in my opinion. 

3. High refresh rate screen... probably won't happen. Most people just genuinely couldn't care less about it, and it would be a great threat to the battery and costs. It would make sense if Apple were the first ones to make high refresh rate phones to lock people in the ecosystem, but now it wouldn't win them many customers. It is possible on the Pro models, but I'm sure it won't happen on the normal ones.

4. Extended storage. Finally a base model of 128GB, with the Pro models disgustingly skipping 256GB and going 128&gt;512&gt;1024",iphone
Why does Apple keep discontinuing models after just a year?,"I’ve heard recently (altough it’s old news) that the iphone 11 pro and pro max were discontinued. That phone is just an year old and along with the xs max and xs, is just better looking and better priced than the 12.
I am currently stuck with a 6s plus which was great to me for the 5 years I had it.
I was planning on upgrading it to the 11 pro max some time next year.
I waited for the 12 pro max but it’s just awful and a waste of money so I refuse to get it.
I already can’t find the xs max in my country anymore, and I saw sites already say “low in stock” or “out of stock” on the 11 pro max and pro models.
By the time I have the money to buy it, i don’t think I’ll be able to find it.
That might mean I will have to switch to android although I hate it. I refuse to buy a 1600 $ ( in my money that would be the sum. It’s extremly expensive.) phone with no charger and no benefits to justify the price. 
However since the iphone 5, I’ve only had iphones, and they never broke like androids do for my family members.
In the time I had this phone my family changed around 3 androids per person. 
Is there a reason for the older models to be discontinued or is apple a greedy little a-hole?",iphone
Where can I see screen width and height comparison for different iphone models?,"I thought it would be simple but a google search only gave me either body dimensions (NOT THE SCREEN) or screen DIAGONAL LENGTH (not WIDTH and HEIGHT). Is there any site that would give us screen WIDTH and HEIGHT? Would like to compare my current phone to iphone 12 / 12 mini

Edit: I have iphone 6s and I’m thinking of upgrading to 12 mini. The screen of 12 mini is much bigger on paper but I feel like it’s narrower.. I just need to make sure if my assumption is true.. does anyone have any info about this?

Edit2: thanks guys! I ended up using the tool in Phone Arena. Despite the overall screen size being larger for iphone 12 mini (iphone 12 mini is 5.4” vs only 4.7” in iphone 6s), the 12 mini is slightly narrower, but taller. This means if I watch a video while on vertical mode, the video will be slightly smaller compared to on phone 6s.

Edit3: make some words uppercase to emphasize my point. I’m not asking for body size or screen size guys. I’m asking specifically screen WIDTH and HEIGHT.

===================== 

LAST EDIT

u/Rcmacc pointed out that The 12 Mini is 0.1” narrower vs iphone 6s.

u/RonnyBrown13 put a link to another reddit thread and it gave me a good idea on how to calculate screen width and height by using screen resolution and pixel density.

Here's what I calculated:

# iphone 6s:

    Screen resolution: 750 x 1334
    pixel density: 325.61

Screen Width: 750 / 325.61 = **2.30 inch** or **5.85 cm**

Screen Height: 1334 / 325.61 = **4.097 inch** or **104.06 cm**

# iphone 12 mini:

    Screen resolution: 1080 x 2340
    pixel density: approx. 476 //couldn't find info about the exact density

Screen Width: 1080 / 476 = **2.269 inch** or **5.76 cm**

Screen Height: 2340 / 476 = **4.916 inch** or **124.86 cm**

&amp;#x200B;

So the screen width actually differs by approx. **0.03""** or **0.9 mm**

That's a very small difference!!! I guess I'm getting the Mini after all. Finally upgrading my phone after more than 5 years hehe thank you guys!!!",iphone

Did i make the right choice..?,"So I’m getting an iPhone 12 soon (my cousin bought it in the UK, he’s coming back tomorrow so I guess I’ll have my phone in a week) and its the 6.1 inch one, with 128 GB and in green color. 

The thing is, I had the option to get 12 Pro but I didn’t since i heard that the camera qualities are pretty much the same, lidar being the only difference, and that the 12 has a slightly better battery life than the pro. So I thought that why not save a hundred pounds if they’re pretty much the same.

And now a lot of people are guilt tripping me lol, asking me why I didn’t buy the pro when i had the choice (especially since i love taking photos of stuff and they all know that) and stuff like that. 

Did i make a stupid choice? Should i have just gotten the Pro model? What are the difference really? I hope the camera in the 12 is not something I’ll regret having. Plus the green iphone is so pretty too.

Be honest pls sjshaajahaha. if i was stupid by getting 12 instead of 12 pro, i guess ill get a pro model when the idk, iphone 20 comes out in 5-6 years?? And if you use a 12, how’s your experience been so far? Thank you so much!!",iphone

iPhone 12 Pro w/Qi wireless charger,"The iPhone 12 Pro is my first phone capable of wireless charging, and it was one of the features I was most excited about. I opted to not go for a MagSafe charger just yet because I just want to be able to just drop the phone on and off the charger without having to physically detach it. The charger I got is a 10W Qi charger from Target. I'm fine with a lower wattage because I just plan to pop it on my nightstand when I crawl into bed.

I was so excited for wireless charging but like...it kinda sucks? Half the time it doesn't charge because it's not aligned just *perfectly*, and when it does charge, the charging light flashes to indicate that there's something interfering with the charge and that it could be damaging to the battery. Is this because of the MagSafe magnets? Do I NEED a MagSafe charger for wireless charging to be a seamless experience? Is it just a shitty charging pad? The case is a MagSafe OtterBox, so maybe I'm just stacking too many magnets in the way. Idk.",iphone

"Prior to the iPhone 12 mini, have you used a ""mini"" variant of a phone when there were other multiple sizes?","I switched over to an iPhone a little over 2 years ago, prior to the changeover I was mainly an Android user for 5 years and Windows Phone guy for 3 years. I strongly considered getting an original iPhone SE but received an iPhone 6s from a friend as a gateway drug to iPhones. From there, I was able to get an iPhone X then to a 12 mini. Looking back at the phones that I have used, I've owned a Sony Xperia z1 Compact and a Nokia Lumia 735 (the Verizon variant of the 730). While Sony probably made the strongest effort to maintain a compact phone with feature parity, I initially switched to Windows phone for the camera (Lumia 1020). I then switched to a Lumia 735 as I was switched to Verizon and the width of the 1020 was bothersome. While it wasn't the smallest (the Lumia 435 takes that title but it was also a entry level phone), it was not available for Verizon.

If anyone is curious, here's how my mini phones stacked up in size:

Is anyone regretting buying the Mini?,"Don’t get me wrong it’s an incredible phone for the price and the form factor but in 2020 when phones are getting to a decent size with good battery life, the fundamentals of what makes a smartphone the Mini just doesn’t hold up even with its performance and incredible cameras.

I have bought mine, used it for a month and I really regret not going for the regular 12 over this. Two reasons, the typing experience and media consumption (videos I shoot or photos I click). I really should’ve been patient and now I’m stuck with the Mini for how long I don’t know. 

Is there someone else like me or are you satisfied with how the Mini is?

**EDIT: Spoke with Apple customer care and the reseller as well. There is no way for me to return the mini &amp; the only option is trade-in after a year. Or I sell the phone outside and buy a new regular 12**",iphone
Wishlist: Live photos in Portrait mode.,"Wish the default camera app allowed for live photos in portrait mode. Live photos really capture the moment better than almost any composition style, which was one of the attractive things about the visual arts and photography. 

At one point, Snapchat and Instagram had some variation of built in filter where you could get a depth of field video. But I'm not sure where that stuff is anymore.

It would be super cool for the iphone to have this feature with all of its metadata and non-destructive editing as well. I feel like the 12 Pro could do this and likely earlier models.",iphone

PSA for iPhone 12 folk: video doesn’t seem to be taken in HDR if it’s done by QuickTake (pressing and holding the camera button in photo mode.) You have to swipe over to video and hit record from there.,"Was noticing that some of my videos but not all of my videos taken since I got my iPhone 12 Pro Max would display the little HDR in the corner of the screen on playback. I couldn’t for the life of me figure out why. A little experimentation and I think I’ve figured it out. 

Video doesn’t seem to be taken in HDR if it’s done by  [QuickTake](https://support.apple.com/en-lamr/guide/iphone/iph61f49e4bb/ios) (pressing and holding the camera button in photo mode to take a video on the fly).  You have to swipe over to video and hit record from there for it to record in HDR. 

Sort of annoying. Assuming this isn’t a bug and an intentional behavior. But I use that quite often because it’s just faster. 

While I’m at it, I’ve got two other gripes.  Is anyone else also irritated that:

1.	During the keynote for the phone they said that ProRaw would work in ALL computational photo modes - but it turns out that doesn’t include portrait mode. Which is def a computational photo mode and something I use a lot and would absolutely want ProRaw for. 
2.	In the default photo app, if you choose the telephoto lens and try to take a photo in low light, it just uses the wide lens and crops it (now 2.5x). This has been the case for years, but it always means those photos look super low res because... they are. Try it, cover the telephoto lens and try and take a photo. In moderate to low light, you’ll still be able to without trouble because it’s using the wide. I get their rational, in that the wide has a wider aperture and a better sensor and therefore produces a better quality image that could reasonably stand to be cropped, but with night mode on all lenses now, you’d think this to be no longer necessary.",iphone
Thinking of returning iPhone 12 mini,"Hello, I want to see how other people feel about this. I got the phone about 2 weeks ago and I started off loving the phone with its form factor, iOS and overall feeling. But as days went by, I noticed this purple smear when watching videos during the evening. I have read this is called OLED smear that is more noticeable on lower brightness with true tone enabled. I didn't have this issue on my Google Pixel (1) which also had an OLED display. I have tried to ignore it, but I notice it and it bugs me.

I have also noticed that having TrueTone enabled looks really yellow compared to the previous iPhones like the X or 11.

The other thing that I have noticed a few times, is how the battery drains somewhat fast during the night (no apps left in background). Sometimes 20-30% loss. Sometimes its fine but not always.

I get it that the first batches of devices can have issues and the battery is probably something to fix with software but it just feels wrong spending around $1000 (Canada) and not having a 'perfect' phone. I have an appointment with Apple in a few days, and they assured me I can either return or exchange if needs be. I'm looking for reassurance but the problems that I notice daily don't make me very confident.

I'm probably being picky. Thoughts?

Edit: I went ahead and did an exchange. Apple person told me I can try it again and can always return until Jan 8th. Yellow tint and battery optimizations I think is something we might see being improved in software but smear will be ultimately my choice to return for.",iphone

See in the dark with a new app that utilizes Apple’s LiDAR &amp; infrared sensors,"[LiDAR NIGHT VISION](https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1544262327) is a new app from Sperry Labs (that’s us)- available for $1 - made for the iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, and the iPad Pro  (4th Generation). It uses both the front and back cameras to allow a user to see their surroundings - even in complete darkness. It uses LiDAR in the back camera, and the infrared sensor in the TrueDepth camera in the front.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

Unlike a regular camera, LiDAR and infrared sensors do not need ambient light.  They both generate their own light, which you cannot see. Therefore, both sensors will work in complete darkness. [Here is a video](https://youtu.be/W_m87krmKVY) with an explanation and showing it in action (with bonus spelunking content). 

The LiDAR Night Vision app turns the world around you into a depth map, where different colors represent distances from your device.

APPLICATIONS

* See in the dark without turning on your flashlight
* Show off your new phone capabilities
* Explore how LiDAR and infrared technology works
* Learn about depth maps and seeing without light

OTHER DEVICES

This app will work on devices that don’t have LiDAR. It will use the front TrueDepth camera to provide a depth map of yourself and objects behind you. The rear-facing display will not work without an iPhone 12 Pro or iPad Pro (4th Generation).

OTHER LiDAR FUN

We'd love to hear your thoughts, comments, and questions. We're pretty big nerds for this stuff and have plans to dig in further on this and other LiDAR applications. If you've found a particular app or app feature useful- we'd love to hear that too.",iphone

IMPORTANT: Changes to the Support System on r/iPhone.,"It’s been two years since we introduced a megathread system as an attempt to curb support request self-posts flooding this subreddit. It has served its purpose well for the most part. However, we do realise that by stuffing all the people looking for help into one post - many people weren’t getting the help they needed in a timely fashion, if at all. We tried different ways of getting more people to help out giving answers in the support megathread, [such as attempting to reach out to current/former Genius Bar employees](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/eydut6/daily_tech_support_thread_flairs/), and reaching out to people that seem well-versed in helping other users out with their iPhone/iOS issues. Unfortunately we didn’t receive much interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Today the mod team has  decided  on  a  change  to  the  support  system,  which we will be trialling over the next 2-3 weeks.  **Starting from 8am EST today (15/12/2020)**, the Daily Tech Support thread will be deactivated and all support requests will instead be redirected to either r/iOS (for  software  related  issues),  or  r/applehelp (for  hardware  issues).  Users  will  be  allowed  to  make  a  self-post  (not  in  a  megathread!)  asking  for  help  with  their  issue,  granted  they  detail  their  issue  properly.  These changes will be reflected in our rules and removal reasons.  

&amp;#x200B;

You may be asking why we are making these changes:

&amp;#x200B;

**(1)** Well, as stated at the beginning of this post, we realise that oftentimes people weren’t getting their issues responded to in a timely fashion, if they ever even received an answer. By allowing users to make their own post detailing the issue they need help with - their issue will gain more visibility which increases the chance of their issue being seen and resolved. 

**(2)** By the tech support thread being removed, we will be freeing up a sticky spot which we can use for other megathreads (such as a photography megathread, app discovery megathread, etc), or for simple announcements. 

*(We’ll be looking into possibly adding on to this new system  by having a bot that can flair a post as “Resolved” when the OP of the support post replies to a user with a solution that worked for them by using a special command like !resolved.)*

&amp;#x200B;

We’ll monitor these changes and come back after the new year and discuss as a mod team. We may also call a community vote to see if they liked the changes or not. This is merely a trial, so nothing is set in stone yet. No harm in trying different options! Of course, people should really be going to Apple Support for their issues, but we do acknowledge that may not be an option all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, this may be the last mod post from us until the new year. I’d like to extend a massive thank you to everyone on the mod team who’s been volunteering their time this year to make this a safe and enjoyable community for iPhone fans from every corner of the globe, and also a huge thanks to all  our  users.  It’s amazing to see this community so close to 3 MILLION users! On  behalf  of  the  r/iPhone mod  team,  we  wish  you  a  well  deserved  holiday,  and  a  healthy  and  happy  new  year!",iphone

Making the switch from Android to iOS,"I've always had phones with big screens. I currently have a samsung S8+ and I am having a hard time deciding on which iphone 12 to get.  I went to best buy to look at them and initially I wanted the 12 pro max - but then I started to think about the weight. Holding my current phone now while sitting or laying down definitely gets my elbow and wrist a bit tired (not weak or anything lol).  The s8+ weighs 6.10 oz. I've had close calls with the s8+ also falling on my face now imagine a pro max lol.

So I think I'm more torn between the 12 pro/mini (256GB). I definitely don't have small hands. I'm a guy with bigger hands than most. I can type one handed on the s8+ but most of the time I place my pinky under the phone. Even with the 6.1 screen reaching the top of the screen with my thumb I had to shift the phone a bit. 

Now...the mini. When I saw the mini I initially thought ""wow the screen isn't as bad as I thought"" (size wise) - and it felt great on my hand. I couldn't really feel the weight of the phones because they are like attached to like the stand and I could only lift them a bit. 

Why I am torn between these two:

- Does the 2 extra GB really make a difference?

- Is the telephoto lens necessary/useful? I saw a YT reviewer mention that the 2x digital zoom on the mini had basically almost the same image quality as the optical 2x of the pro.

- The weight - 12 pro being 6.66oz is already heavier than the s8+

- Battery life is a given in the mini, but is it really that bad? Have people thought about the battery life a year or 2 after? With the smaller battery, a hit in battery life degradation will be more noticeable later down the road.

- is the brightness peak difference even noticeable?

- I bought an apple watch series 6 and plan to wear it almost all day. Does this affect battery life on iphones?

If I were to get the mini I might just keep it for 2 years because it's disappointing that the pros did not get 120hz screens. I think it would be a good idea to wait for apple to balance 120hz and 5G when it comes to battery life. That might not happen next year. 

I do have an ipad 8th gen and when I am home I either try to watch YT videos on that or my TV. I am currently WFH due to covid and won't be back to the office anytime soon. So that's why I'm also leaning towards the mini 

Sorry for the long post! Just really torn about it and I will be new to the apple ecosystem! Thanks!

"I made Songpocket, a music app that lets you organize your music manually","I made Songpocket, a music player that lets you organize your music manually. And it’s free!

[Songpocket on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/songpocket/id1538037231)

In Songpocket, you can …

- Reorder albums, artists, and songs
- Move albums into customizable collections

Manual reordering is useful because it lets you do things that no automatic sort option can. For example, you can group similar artists together, and put your favorites at the top.

Moving albums between collections is useful because it lets you group albums by whatever grouping style works best for each one. For example, you can make collections for classical albums by the same composer, or collections for soundtracks from the same franchise, and keep them alongside collections for pop albums by the same artist.

Not only is that a useful way to browse, it also makes your music collection feel more personal, like a physical music collection!

"Those who upgraded from 11 Pro Max to 12 Pro Max, thoughts?","I’m on the fence with making the upgrade myself. I’m pleased with the 11Pro Max, but I love the look of the sides on the 12. Is the camera noticeably different? Noticeably faster? The larger screen not too much? 

Just looking for thoughts on those who upgraded. I’ve watched tons of videos but would like to hear from people who either enjoyed the upgrade or felt meh.

EDIT: THANKS to everyone who commented. Man, iPhone users are awesome and you all shared a lot for me to think about. To clarify, I'm on a yearly upgrade plan with Sprint also, so since I've had my phone 8 months, the real cost of an upgrade would only be about $350-400. I pay about $30/month for it and the iPhone 12 PM would be about the same. The difference is I was thinking about buying this phone off when the lease ends and just keeping it for several more years, which I know it will last. So the question to me is is it worth paying $350-400 to keep the iPhone 12PM for 3-4 years or keep this one? IDK, I'm leaning toward keeping it. MagSafe is cool, but honestly, I like the fast charging cables. It's always more fun making a huge jump than a small one from year to year. Update tendencies are real! lol",iphone

"Am I alone in the community? A rant, plea, and hopeful redirection for the future of Apple","I've been a iPhone owner and early-adopter since the first one dropped in June, 2007. I have always placed fate in the company and staunch supporter in defense of any of its drawbacks in comparison to their competition. However, this is the first year that I have honestly felt 'cheated' by the company, and I am having a hard time justifying my purchase of the 12 Pro Max. To me, Apple and particularly its iPhone have always represented quality. Quality in design, quality in customer service, quality in the overall experience. This quality always stood paramount to any drawbacks the phone may have had in comparison to its competition. Minor things like not having some unique/niche apps in the app store? I'd justify it as their QoS keeping garbage out of the store and felt secure that anything I downloaded would be worthy purchase. The price in comparison to the competition? The company backs their product steadfast and I don't mind paying more having peace in mind that they are (at least attempting) to provide a fairer market in regards to production and environmental concerns.

However, that feeling has become more and more fleeting since the competition has gained ground and more and more of my inner-circle jump ship. Simple things like my inability to automate my house without really annoying and absurd work arounds. I can't 'pretty up' my phone without having to annoyingly jump through the shortcuts app screen every time. My friends can go to any house and cast to any modern TV without having to worry if that TV has an expensive proprietary hardware. I can't text pictures to anyone without a iPhone without it looking like potato-quality. Granted, this is an issue between Apple and others; it isn't an issue between the rest.

My biggest gripe is wanting to unify my house' ecosystem. I have no qualms in shelling out the cash for Apple TV and HomePod(s). However, these devices work so haphazardly and clunky with simple things, like just simply asking my vacuum to clean. I can do it, but the amount of effort that has to be provided goes counter in my mind what Apple represents: ""It just works."" When I bring up these gripes, my still staunch iPhone friends defend it with, ""just give it time, they are working to make it better."" How much time do I have to keep giving to this company? Why do I have to wait years for them to 'perfect' the software to their standard, when their standard at this price point is hardly competitive anymore. 

What's worse, as a front-end developer who spends their life in the Windows eco-system; a system that ""just works,"" I find these minor issues mounting more and more with each iteration of their software and devices.

The latest announcement of their **AirPods Max** really broke me. I had been really excited for this product; however, for the first time since the inception of the iPhone I cannot justify this purchase. Why would I pay $550 for this product that is eclipsed by products in the same price range? This isn't representative of the company I bought into thirteen years ago.

What has happened to you Apple? I want the solid production of Apple products back, not what comes across as cheap cash grabs with minor improvements in each iteration. I still love my iPhone, however it is becoming apparent to me with each iteration between it and its competitors I find myself trying to find reasons to justify why I stick with the company.

Apple, you were an innovator, and now you barely cling to relevancy. I now have to work between lighting and USB-C products within your own line. I can barely use your product with any other device. And the latest iOS upgrade has been so terrible, my phone stops functioning properly a good fifth of the time.

Come back to me Apple. I miss you.",iphone

11 Pro Battery,"It’s been just under 2 months since I switched from the Pixel 3 to the 11 Pro (used) and the battery of the 11P still amazes me

I’m not sure how Apple does it so efficiently considering Pixel 3 has a 2915 mAh battery compared to 11P’s 3046 mAh, which isn’t a huge upgrade

To put it into context, I get to work by 9am and leave around 6pm. With the Pixel 3, I’d be lucky if I had 60-50% left by 12pm with normal usage (web browsing, Instagram/Reddit/Twitter) which is fairly light imo. That was also with Bluetooth turned off. I have a portable charger that I used daily for the pixel

It is now 5:41pm local time and I’m still at 67% with the same usage and the last time I charged my phone was before I left to go to work around 8am. I haven’t even used my portable charger since I got my iPhone, which is wild to process after using pixel 3 for the past 2 years. That alone makes the jump to iphones 100% worth it for me, not to mention the smoother software experience with a bigger screen and better build quality

I know the 11 Pro is only a year old but I remember the pixel 3 got noticeably worse with the battery after a year of usage so this makes me confident that I can keep my phone for at least 2-3 more years depending on how the new iPhones are down the road",iphone

Current status of the iMessage missing notifications issue in iOS 14.2.x,"I just spoke with Apple support since I, like others  I’ve read about in this sub, have not been receiving all of my iMessage notifications. Here are a few relevant things to know.

- I recently got the 12 pro, and the advisor asked what phone I transferred from (iPhone 7)
- The advisor had me turn Settings &gt; Messages &gt; iMessage off and back on
- The advisor asked if I had “Attention Aware Features” enabled for Face ID (I do) and they told me to disable it (though I re-enabled myself shortly after)
- I asked the advisor if the issue would be fixed in 14.3, to which they responded “I believe it should, as there are a few software issue that was made to Apples attention. I would definitely look out for the update.”

This is speculative, but it seems to me like perhaps the issue of missing notifications has something to do with transferring from an old phone without Face ID to a new iPhone with it. Is this also the case for those of you with the same issue?

Edit 1: looks like people who did not recently upgrade are having this issue. Here’s a better question: is anyone experiencing the issue on an iPhone running iOS 14 that does NOT have Face ID capability?

Edit 2: This seems to be an issue faced by those with and without phones with Face ID capability. However, I must say that after my experience with Apple support turning iMessage and Attention Aware Features off and back on, I have yet to miss a notification (since a few hours ago).

Edit 3: Apple appears to have fixed this bug with the release of iOS 14.3 today (December 14, 2020)

TL;DR - Apple is aware of some iPhones not showing notifications properly. It’ll probably be fixed in iOS 14.3. In the meantime, turning off Settings &gt; FaceID &gt; Attention Aware Features might help. Turning Settings &gt; Messages &gt; iMessage off and back on might help.

Hope this helps!",iphone

TrueCaller is a scam app that doesn't actually do anything,"  

Thank you for contacting us!  
 

Unfortunately, Apple has a few restrictions on its platform which prevents us from developing the same caller ID features as on Android. We hope they drop these restrictions soon, so we can start developing the same caller ID functions as in our Android app.  
 

Until then, caller ID for iPhone requires a few things from your end and the caller's end:

· Please enable the following for a more reliable Caller ID experience: iPhone Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Call Blocking &amp; Identification &gt; Enable Truecaller Part 1, 2 &amp; 3. 

· The app must be running in the background (please don't force-quit Truecaller by double-tapping the home button/home indicator and swiping up)

· Please make sure that ""Background App Refresh"" is enabled by going to iPhone Settings &gt; General &gt; Background App Refresh &gt; Find Truecaller and toggle it on.

· The person who's calling you must call from inside Truecaller on Android or iPhone and should have a 3G, 4G, or a strong WiFi connection and the latest Truecaller version.",iphone

Shipping times for 20w power adapters have slipped to 2 full weeks and I think this reveals a glaring problem with Apple’s “environmental strategy.”,"Apple’s most reasonably priced power brick is now going to take longer to ship than most people’s devices. Imagine that you are new to the ecosystem, and you can’t even purchase the brick needed to charge your brand new phone.

I made this discovery when attempting to purchase a [MagSafe Duo](https://imgur.com/a/ObszdSd) for a trip next week, which, thanks to Apple’s new strategy, doesn’t even include the brick it needs to work. This sort of experience is going to lead to a lot of unhappy customers.

Thoughts?

Edit: Some things to add

- MagSafe requires a newer charging brick standard known as PD 3.0 to reach advertised speeds. They also all use USB-C. So those are two very solid reasons why the “brick laying around the house” isn’t going to cut it.

- The paramount issue at hand is that, as a result of the newer charging standard + USB-C, I need a new brick for my MagSafe Duo to accomplish its purpose. Apple opted not to give me one with the Duo, so I have to buy one. They created extra steps for me, and were unable to meet the demand that *they* created for these power bricks.

- Yes obviously other bricks can be bought from other retailers, some even supporting PD 3.0. But no storefront in the world should be effectively encouraging you to shop elsewhere. It’s a bad customer experience for me, and lost money for Apple.",iphone

What can I expect with AppleCare+?,"**TL:DR -** I just signed up with AppleCare+, what can I expect? I know that prices are discounted and that's obviously why I got it, but what are the Pros and Cons? Are there long wait times/irregular windows of repair times? Hidden fees? What are your experiences with it. Below is just me explaining my situation for really no reason at all.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I got my iPhone 12PM on release and have had a case and screen protector on it since I took it out of the box. I noticed today there was a crack on the edge of the screen protector, and while I don't think its on the screen itself, it got me super paranoid. I had 58 days left to register with AppleCare+ so I went ahead and did it just in case.

I'm mainly worried becasue my all-time favorite iPhone before the X was my 8 Plus. I saw myself using it for years and years, but one night I dropped it and the screen shattered. Under the screen protector. The screen protector was completely flawless, but the phone itself had shattered. I was heart-broken. The XS Max had just come out, and I had paid off my 8, so I went ahead and upgraded. I'm glad I did, as I had planned to sell my 8 and got the screen replaced on it. Well, of course if you go to a third party to get it replaced, you can literally feel the difference. The screen was just... different. It felt weird to type and the 3D touch was replaced with the long-touches we have now instead of the force-sensitive screen it had.

I'm just trying to figure out if my paranoia is justified and even if I don't end up needing AppleCare+, it's a good thing to have.",iphone

DAE Still Prefer the iPhone 5/5s/SE Form Factor?,"I have small hands. Used Androids up through the Sony Z5 Compact (4.6”), then switched teams for the 1st gen iPhone SE (4”). Absolutely loved it, and awaited somebody to make another small phone. That took a while (I’d tried the 6/7/8; much too big). Finally, Apple comes out with the iPhone 12 mini, and of course I was thrilled at the prospect. 

Been using it since launch, and I… mostly like it. Losing the home button and touch ID, while gaining the notch, have surprisingly been non-issues. I got used to the task switching gesture quickly. The cameras are amazing. But I have a hard time reaching the whole screen with my thumb. I use my phone with my left hand, and swiping down for Control Center is virtually impossible (I really wish you could switch it to the top left).

For unremarkable reasons, I had to use my old 2016 SE again for a couple days and… totally fell in love with it again. It’s just so darn easy to wield. Video and web browsing were perfectly fine. And honestly, I didn't miss the screen real estate at all. Maybe I’m just wired strangely, as I can’t tell the difference while looking at OLED vs. LCD, and couldn’t perceive ProMotion when I used an iPad Pro.

I guess my brain expects different things from different devices. If I want to do serious computing, I use my Mac. If I want to watch a movie, I use my television. Even the most gigantic smartphone sucks for these things, by comparison. So I want my phone to be as small as possible, optimizing for convenience and portability instead of viewing experience.

tl;dr I wish the iPhone 12 mini was smaller.

Am I crazy? Has anyone had a similar experience?",iphone
How important is a phone's camera to you?,"A lot of phone marketing for the past few years has been centered around the camera. Phone manufacturers seem to think that it's one of the top priorities for consumers, and I suppose it must be if they're focusing on it so much. Am I the odd one out for not personally caring about camera quality?

The importance of a phone's camera is very dependent on use case. For example, I don't take many photos at all--I pretty much only take photos if I travel somewhere I've never been, and I very rarely do. This means I especially don't need things like night mode photos or portrait mode (since I'm not taking pictures of people).

I expect a lot of people have a similar use case and don't take lots of photos, especially of people or at night. But I want to know what people *really* think: how important is the camera to you when considering a new phone? Do you take lots of photos/videos?",iphone

[RUMOR/DISCUSSION] Apple Removing the Lightning Port from the iPhone,"Okay so I've been thinking about Apple removing the charge port on the iPhone for a while now and it is utterly ridiculous. If we were to compare removing the charge port to removing the headphone jack, then that would mean that there exists some form of charging that is equivalent to bluetooth (i.e. can charge your phone when you're a few feet away, at least). However, that doesn't exist. ""Wireless"" charging isn't really wireless, it's ""portless"". 

Most ""wireless"" chargers are just little pads to just rest your phone on to charge overnight or while you work; Qi charging is meant to compliment wired charging until the range (and wattage) of wireless charging is *DRASTICALLY* improved. Now, if Apple managed to create such a wireless charger that actually reached across the room then removing the charge port would be the right move but their emphasis on MagSafe suggests that they believe that MagSafe is the future, which it is not. Also, how is MagSafe better than an actual port? There is still a wire attached to the MagSafe puck, meaning that you're still limited by the 3-6 ft of the cable you're using. 

The only ""real"" benefit I see to removing the charge port is even better water resistance and a larger battery. But iPhones are already very resistant to water, so the improvement will be miniscule at best (and I know that it could make the phones resistant to seawater but the number of people who want to take their phone *into* the ocean is very small, especially given that most states here in America are nowhere near an ocean).  Also, phones nowadays have 4500 mAh batteries in them while leaving room for a charge port, IP 68 rating, and under-display fingerprint sensors, so Apple could add this to their phones while still keeping the port.

The only reason that Apple would do this is to make more money, which is fine because that is the only purpose of a business. But to lie to their consumers that it is anything but an attempt to increase their profits would be a disgrace to the consumers.

TL;DR They shouldn't remove the port because wireless charging is not a good replacement, the upsides don't justify it, wired audio is gone, and USB-C is just better.",iphone
Does anyone else not like the new iPhones’ design?,"I’m referring to all the iPhones from X onward. I just could never get into it. It has no home button, which I’m far too used to to do without. I also don’t like the shape of the screen—with its rounded corners and especially with that black tab on top. It just looks so ugly. At this point I’m the only one out of all my friends who doesn’t have an iPhone with that design. I much prefer my iPhone SE, which I just upgraded from my iPhone 7. I look around when I go out in public and I notice I’m often the only one still with an iPhone with its classic design; they all have one with the new design. It’s also a bonus that my phone happens to be the cheapest. 

I just can’t stand the thought of not having a home button. Closing out of apps, calling Siri, switching between apps, etc. seems like such a hassle without it. My brother (who has the 11) even admits the facial recognition unlock doesn’t even work in the mornings, forcing him to enter a passcode. I’m not sure what I would do if I no longer had the thumbprint ID, which is so damn easy to use. 

Am I really the only one? Is it really that tiny of a minority at this point? The only reason I worry is because Apple might discard this design for good, and I can’t keep this phone forever, so I might have no choice but to get an iPhone with the new design if I want to keep iOS.",iphone

Should Apple have kept the 5.8’’ screen size?,"Thanks to smaller bezels, the 12/12 Pro with 6.1’’ screens aren’t *that* much bigger than the 5.8’’ models of the past — but they are still bigger. 

Would it be better if Apple kept the screen size but used smaller bezels to shrink the size of the phone?

iPhone SE 2020 users: Opinions on the front facing camera?,"I really want a new phone that takes decent selfies because the old android I have has terrible picture quality (hazy, bad colors, my family and I notice a lot of distortion in pictures of me) The iPhone SE seems great but I read that it has the same front facing camera as the iPhone 11 which I couldnt help but notice a lot of people found unflattering and lacking in a lot of ways (there were some particularly unhappy reviews on youtube). The iPhone SE is the best for in my budget but I worry I'll be unhappy yet again and be back to avoiding taking any pictures of myself",iphone
Wired Carplay in a portless iPhone world,I've been thinking about how Carplay will work when iPhone's go portless.

The iPhone 12 over sharpens pictures.,"I upgraded to an iPhone 12 Prom from my iPhone X, the primary reason being the new cameras. Initially I was ecstatic and enjoyed the crazy HDR as well as the stellar night mode. However about a week in I noticed that my pictures looked “crunchy” if that makes sense. Looking back at my older pictures I noticed that the way my iPhone X captured image detail looked smoother, and more natural. I ended up not doing much with this realization because I had traded in my X and was unable to do a direct comparison.

However recently I’ve been taking a lot of pictures in forrest settings and the over sharpening has become nauseating in some shots that have lots of branch’s and twigs. I ended up downloading ProCam and shot some photos in RAW mode to see if I noticed a difference, and it was stunning. The iPhone’s computational post processing that is applied automatically is applying an extreme amount of over sharpening. Here are four pictures below showcasing this (View on desktop for best resolution. If on mobile, use app)

https://imgur.com/a/YxOMDiW

In the first picture it is most clear how much softer the tree looks. In this case the sharpening does look better, however I chose this picture because it proves for better or for worse, that the AI is sharpening photos, and by quite a lot. Where the issue comes into play is that this excessive sharpening fails often making pictures look like cheap, for example this city street:

https://imgur.com/a/Wq5peMP

Take notice of the power lines and tree branches. The sharpening is turned up so high that there is a white boarder around those objects. This is the type of editing I expect to see on an over filtered instagram picture from 2015, not a $1,000 unedited phone camera. You can see this over sharpening again butchering photos in this picture of a mountain side:

https://imgur.com/a/RtaM7ao

On the middle right where the most foliage is you can once again see how the sharpening takes very detailed area and accentuates this detail to the extreme. This looks very bad as the multiple over lapping leaves and branches all of which have become extremely sharpened begin to blend into a noisy blob.

There are mostly certainly areas where this sharpening is successful, but I have found more often than not it damages my photo and makes it look far to noisy and busy. What makes it worse is my only option to avoid this is by shooting raw in a non native camera app that doesn’t given me access to smart HDR and simply isn’t as convenient.

So what do you guys think? Do you enjoy the sharpening and find it to look good, or are you in the same boat as me?",iphone

iPhone 12 Pro Max vs 11 Pro Max LTE speed tests with full signal vs low signal,"Hi everyone, 

I'm quite a nerd when it comes to monitoring cell networks. One of the biggest reasons I upgraded from the 11 Pro Max to the 12 Pro Max is the switch to Qualcomm and benefits that come with this.

Although I don't have a 5G plan yet, I already see great improvements in the speeds I'm getting, especially at the cell edge (applies to both data and voice calls).


So, here are my results:

Indoor, low signal (B3 - 1800MHz - 20MHz Bandwidth):

iPhone 12 Pro Max: 15.9Mbps Download, 1.11Mbps Upload

iPhone 11 Pro Max: Test wouldn't even start, I only got it to start once, Download was about 3-4Mbps but it failed when doing the Upload.

Outdoor, great signal (B3 - 1800MHz - 20MHz BW + B7 - 2600MHz - 20MHz BW = 40MHz BW in total):

iPhone 12 Pro Max:208Mbps Download, 48.7Mbps Upload

iPhone 11 Pro Max:176Mbps Download, 46.1Mbps Upload


I'm happy with the upgrade. I can use 4G LTE everywhere inside my house and reception is a lot more reliable in general compared to my iPhone 11 Pro Max.

No drop except maybe fumbling it when picking it up and drop a few inches.

What to do with old iPhone 6 phone after upgrading,"I have a iPhone 6 I’ve had for years and I just got a new iPhone 8 Plus almost a month ago. I love it !! But now I have the iPhone 6 just lying around. The battery is pretty swollen and lifts the screen up. I’ve replaced the battery around 6 times within 3 years. I’m so tired of fixing the battery every 3-4 months. I don’t have any battery issues with my iPhone 8 Plus. Not sure what to do with it. I don’t need it.
Should I give it to someone, or sell it and fix the battery ?  If I get a new battery that would just make me spend/waste more money. If I try to sell it where should I try to sell it. I’m pretty scared to still have it here with swollen battery. Thanks

Edit: I know some people are saying use it as an iPod &amp;amp;amp;amp; for music, but I already have 2 iPods 😩 One I use for music and the other headphone jack is stuck inside lol. So the 2nd one I don’t really use.

Edit: Thanks everyone ! I met up with a friend and she bought it for $145. I had a outterbox case, screen protector with it, and gave her a new charger I didn’t need, so I charged a little extra. And she said will just get a new battery ! I’m glad it’s not in my care anymore lol",iphone
Scam alert: Beware when buying secondhand iPhones,"I’ve been reading a few accounts of people purchasing used recent-year model iPhones, and getting scammed...

This is essentially happening like this:

Seller: Buys new iPhone from Apple and signs up for Apple Care + with Theft and Loss coverage. Lists phone for sale on an online marketplace such as Craigslist or Facebook marketplace. Usually for a couple hundred less than retail price in order to draw in buyers.

Buyer: Enticed by the steep discount, meets with seller. Phone appears to be in working condition, the SIM works in the device, and everything seems okay. Buyer pays seller in cash and they part ways.

Seller: Later reports iPhone as missing or stolen to Apple. Seller pays deductible and gets brand new replacement iPhone from Apple. Apple then blacklists the allegedly “stolen” phone.

Buyer: Discovers phone suddenly does not work and cannot connect to carrier network, unaware the device has been blacklisted. Buyer unable to find or contact the seller any longer. Apple will not remove device blacklist...essentially leaving buyer with a very expensive brick.

Basically, if something is too good to be true, DO NOT go for it. Please use good judgment. This includes buying from resale sites on eBay or Swappa.

When such high priced items being exchanged, just save up the money and buy directly from your carrier or from Apple. You may be paying full retail prices, but better than being scammed out of hundreds of dollars and left with a brick.",iphone

Moving from Android to iPhone? Great! Disable RCS.,"I've been at my neck for 3 days since i got my iPhone about why there was a constant error with activating iMessage. Talking to apple support for over 30 minutes - 1 hour for each time, wondering why my specific issue wasn't fixed. 

Recently I forgot I hadn't wiped my old phone, and all my texts were going through to it (RCS texts), so I couldn't send any messages from my iPhone, and I wondered why. 

I decided to factory reset my Android after moving my stuff, which automatically disables RCS. I had to reset tho because even though I disabled RCS in my settings, it didn't fully deactivate.

Randomly remembered that I had factory reset it, and lo and behold, I was activated with iMessage within 10 seconds.

TLDR: If you're moving from Android, either factory reset your phone or disable RCS (chat features). It somehow fucked with my iMessage activation.

EDIT: If you sold the phone or don’t have it anymore, use this google form: (https://messages.google.com/disable-chat) and scroll to the bottom to deregister your number, however a commenter told me it takes around 8-9 for them to deregister it, server side, which is quite awful to be honest.",iphone

Don’t buy the leather case... not worth it.,"I’ve always had the saddle leather iPhone case... they have always held up (for me). I’m WFH (even pre-covid) so outside of the case going in and out of my pocket throughout the day the case really gets no use or wear to speak of. So when I purchased my new 12 Pro Max I of course immediately grabbed the leather case (shipped prior to receiving the phone). I’ve had the phone (in case) for 2.5 weeks and this is the wear I’m already experiencing... this is ridiculous. I don’t even have this much wear on previous Apple leather cases after years of use. You can tell the case is some very VERY thin leather (type-product) almost painted onto a plastic shell. This is a joke, never again. Be forewarned, it’s not worth it.

Diy MagSafe charger for older iPhones,"One of the things that i like about the new iPhone 12 is the MagSafe, however, its not worth it for me to upgrade from my current iPhone Xs max.

I however, found MagSafe magnets membrane and a wireless charger car mount that is compatible with with MagSafe in AliExpress:

I ordered them and got them today. I tried to tape the MagSafe magnet membrane to the external side of my iPhone cover, and then attach the MagSafe wireless charger. It was charging fine, but I haven’t testing the charging speed yet; theoretically, it should charge the iPhone with 7.5 W; But as you can see in the video below, it looks ugly and the tape won’t stick to the cover. I might try to glue the membrane to the cover, however, ideally i want the MagSafe to be hidden inside the cover. I will try to contact Chinese case suppliers to see if they can make MagSafe cases for older iPhones.

Rushed it home as the case showed no signs of water logging so it had dried out for 24-48 hours apparently after snow melted, plugged it in, and it turned on within 2 minutes, it’s been 9 hours and has shown no signs of damage or malfunctioning.

Anyone just turn off Face ID nowadays?,"I'm highly considering it.

The only time I'm not wearing a mask is when I'm driving (in which case I'm not using my phone anyway) and at home (in which case I just keep my computer on and use that instead). Has anyone just switched to using pass code by default and found it to be easier? I'm also considering just saying fuck it and turn off phone locking altogether.

"S21 goes to X (No Signal) Verizon, Possible Solution.","In short, using my new S21 5G, I have had my signal drop to X meaning no data connection to Verizon many times a day for the last 10 days or so. In that time, I have factory reset the phones, reset all network settings, set network mode to manual (Verizon), got a new sim from Verizon, spoke with Samsung twice, spoke with Verizon, been to the Verizon store 5 times, and have received a new S21 5G from Verizon with the issue continuing. None of those solutions stopped the problem.

Now, after the 5th store trip and a chat with a rep, I think I might have stumbled upon the solution. During the chat, the rep mentioned he turns his 5G off to stop the switch between 4G and 5G to save battery. That got me thinking, what if all the network bouncing between 4G and 5G I have seen, even just standing in the Verizon store, and the X signal are connected? That said, this issue did only appear recently as in the past 10 days after I installed two updates, so I am not ruling out an update messed something up.

So my theory is that the phone bounces between the 4G and 5G network so much that the phone either gets stuck at no network connection or verizon kicks the phone off temporarily due to excessive request. Right now I am forcing the phone to use the LTE bands using the app Samsung Band Selection on the play store.

In theory you can do the same with Tasker with root, or more cumbersome granting tasker special permission using adb wifi using usb debugging.

In Samsung Band Selection I have network set to LTE ALL under Network Mode. You could use Band Selection to force certain LTE bands, or you could force 5G by using the NR bands. I hope this helps.

Right now, I have had a stable connection for about 3 hours, which is a long time at this point. I have lost connection 3 times in 15 minutes before due to whatever is causing the issue. So this is more a theory in the works than a foolproof solution.

I hope the rest of you experiencing this problem find this helpful in at least knowing you are not alone with this issue.",Android

[Concept screenshot] Memory card mass storage access options,"## [Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/Ixcdmgn)
[(Direct PNG link)](https://i.imgur.com/My4x1J1.png)

This is a custom-made screenshot of how I would image mass storage be implemented.

Mass storage access to the internal storage was originally possible on many devices, but these days, would be impractical due to file system incompatibility, encryption, interference with system architecture, and more.

But pass-through mass storage access only to the memory card is far more realistic, regarding that memory cards (portable storage) usually use a widely supported file system. It would just need to unmount the memory card, and mount back again after finishing.

I imagine how this would facilitate file transfers to the computer. For users who are unsure, the read-only mode can be used, which would make it act like an SD card reader which obeys the write protect switch.

Mass storage access could also be used for USB Hi-Fi systems, as many lack support for MTP, and searching through files with mass storage is significantly faster.",Android

"[Concept screenshot] Extended MTP options: One-tap connection reset, write access toggle, preserve date and time stamps, and optionally only share a single directory.","# [Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/aEqs6MD)
[PNG link](https://i.imgur.com/FJjwxtu.png)

## Reset connection
MTP frequently hangs up, for example when renaming files. It would be convenient if the connection could be reset with a single tap. Since Android 7 Nougat, it can be reset by re-tapping on *MTP* in the [USB option selector](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/m2rbop/concept_screenshot_memory_card_mass_storage/.compact), but that needs to be opened from the notification menu.

## Enable write access
Sometimes, I just want to get files from the device, without having to take care not to mess up anything. This could be more convenient in such a situation.

## Preserve date and time stamps
It looks like more recent devices [do support this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/lv87rt/observation_mtp_file_transfers_preserve_original/.compact). It was in demand [for quite some time](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/q-mtp-file-transfer-how-can-i-keep-the-original-timestamps-for-the-copied-files.1477876/#post-35873169).

Also see: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/35580/how-can-i-transfer-photos-to-my-android-jelly-bean-device-while-preserving-the-o

## Only share one directory
Could be useful if I am on a friend's computer, and just want to drop or get files without his computer having access to the all files.

Google likes scoped storage, don't they? Why not give that **option** (not enforcement) for MTP?",Android

Concept of a pipe dream: Per-app extended storage settings [screenshot],"^(Side note: Because image posts are deactivated here, I posted the screenshot to an external site.)

[This custom-made screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/bxeJF9j) ^(()[^(PNG link)](https://i.imgur.com/KKX2DZx.png)^()) is a concept of how storage access controls could have been implemented in Android OS, and would allow legacy file access to co-exist with Google's “Storage Access Framework” (SAF).

If you have suggestions for improving this screenshot, please comment.

# The idea

Rather than imposing a blanket restriction and causing lots of colleteral damage and massive frustration among users, users should have been given per-app options for storage access, all the way since 2014 (Android 4.4 KitKat, which also removed 4.3 Jelly Bean's “app-ops”, only to bring such a feature back in version 6.0 Marshmallow). This would also prevent breaking compatibility with existing established apps.

Problems with “Storage Access Framework” (SAF): High latency, poor documentation (possibly improved by now), and lack of backwards compatibility: [https://www.xda-developers.com/android-q-storage-access-framework-scoped-storage/](https://www.xda-developers.com/android-q-storage-access-framework-scoped-storage/)

&amp;#x200B;

At this moment, no good file manager has proper file access, and also I found no way to revoke access from a specific folder once granted via the system's own folder selector. Amaze File Manager is the best open-source file manager I am aware of, but it lacks [range selection](https://enwp.org/ES_File_Explorer#Range_selection), and the pre-adware ES File Explorer versions such as 3.1.0.x were made before SAF was around. Amaze File Manager also lacks FTP client (while supporting FTP serving!), but SAF-enabled “File Manager HD” by RhythmSoft has that at least. But again, RhythmSoft's file manager sadly also lacks range selection.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

No text editor that is as good as QuickEdit supports it yet. Even the built-in text editor of Amaze File Manager is unable to write to files through SAF. All these compatibility breaches are painful, and one has to wait until apps adapted to SAF are finally around. Or update functional apps and risk that the developer tried to ""fix"" something that was not broken in the first place, making things worse.

&amp;#x200B;

SAF is slow (in my own experience, but also confirmed by XDA), the Terminal apps do not support it yet, and if I move files within the memory card using Amaze File Manager or RhythmSoft File Manager HD, the files are copied and then deleted from the source directory, instead of directly moved (how moving is supposed to work), which is a massive waste of resources and rewriting cycles.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, but these are just too many problems.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

All these chaos and frustration would have been spared if what is shown in this concept screenshot had been implemented. And I see no downsides to it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, some might say that with such freedom come risks. However, it is the user's obligation to grant file access responsibly. Imagine Microsoft blanket-revoking file access to USB flash media for all non-Microsoft programs “for security reasons”, or Internet access altogether! Except that Windows Explorer is a good file manager, while Google DocumentsUI is stinking feature-crippled garbage: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/jj4mwl/warning\_possible\_bug\_in\_builtin\_file\_manager/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/jj4mwl/warning_possible_bug_in_builtin_file_manager/).",Android

Finally back on Android but with a few reservations,"Just upgraded from iPhone 11 pro max to S21 ultra

A few takeaways:

First of all this phone is amazing! I've been on ios since the iPhone X (had the pixel 2 and note 8 before that) 

• With one ui 3, samsung has really improved since the TouchWiz days! Everything is so customizable and haven't even thought about switching to nova launcher yet, especially since they added the google discover page to the home screen. 

• I thought I would miss imessage the most from ios but I actually don't...I do miss certain things like my apple watch, airdrop and most importantly APP OPTIMIZATION! Android apps really get the short end of the stick when it comes to this issue. The majority of apps in my use case just run a bit better on iPhone. Not a deal breaker but still worth mentioning.

Overall, I don't regret the switch. The fact that I have control over exactly how I want my phone to be, to place my apps where I want them, using multi window to use two apps at once &amp; utlizing smart gestures to elimate hand gymnastics to reach anything remotely at the top of the screen (ios needs to fix this ASAP &amp; no reachability is not the answer)

I like using both ios &amp; android and am not biased towards either.  For now this phone suits my needs, but maybe some day I'll hop back on ios.

Anyone else make this switch or thinking about it?",Android

Why I'm worried about the OnePlus 9's 4K 120 recording capability...,"Hasselblad did not put any of their optics or sensors into the OnePlus 9, they basically kinda gave OnePlus color science advice.

So, it all comes down to 2 things, software and hardware. It's going to be using a new Sony IMX789, which is good news, but it will still be smaller than the S21 Ultra's near 1 inch sensor.

And software... we'll see. OnePlus cameras lean between being great, and wierdly disappointing. And the new 4K 120FPS recording option looks like it's setup to fail. 

I could maybe trust the feature in Samsung or Apple's hands, but the fact that OnePlus is going to a launch a big camera feature, while not being great at camera software does not look good at all.

It's like McDonald's announcing they're adding gourmet steaks to the menu, when they don't know much on how to get your order right in the first place.

The higher the resolution, and the higher framerate you capture, youre getting less light as well.

 Sometimes my dad's S21 will capture clearer 1080p 60 video, than 4K 60 even if decent lit scenarios, just because more light is entering the sensor.

 If you were to bump that up to 120fps, even on 1080p, (you know how slow mo looks) it's a noisy mess. Try bumping that up to 4K 120, and you might as well start recording in 720p. 

I think OnePlus is punching above their level, and they might trip and fall. I hope that maybe Hasselblad also sprinkled in some camera magic.",Android

Old Facebook Messenger Chat Heads on Android 11 Workaround,"Hey everyone,

If you're on a newer phone running Android 11, you might be as frustrated as me with the new buggy 'chat bubbles' feature that Messenger opted for instead of their original 'chat heads'. I found a temporary workaround to use the original 'chat heads' until they fix the feature and thought others might benefit.

Steps:

* Uninstall Messenger (You can leave Facebook for authentication)
* Download a APK of Messenger version 266 (There's plenty of sites out there)
* Install this APK and open it, apply your settings and open a chat head
   * You need to open a chat head before updating to the latest version or this won't work
* Go to the Play Store and update the app (If you don't, then you lose the ability to send pictures)
* Hold a conversation and select 'Open chat head', which appears instead of 'Show as bubble'
* You're now free to swipe the 'chat heads' and open it again via getting a message or the method above.

This workaround has been working for me for a while, but it does reset itself if the app closes for any reason (multitasking, crashes, memory cleanup, restarting, etc). Swiping the bubbles away seems to be fine as long as the base app doesn't close. The steps above will need to be repeated if this happens.

If you don't need to send pictures for whatever reason, you can keep the older version and not update the app. You will need to disable automatic updates in Messenger and Play Store for this, however.

I'm calling this a workaround instead of a solution since it will 'break' very easily. Even if your system settings disables the 'chat bubbles', Messenger will instead send a defunct notification that doesn't do anything when trying to open a 'chat bubble'.

My understanding is the newer versions of the app that support 'chat bubbles' have the original code for 'chat heads' to support pre-Android 11. However, if the system detects you can use the 'chat bubbles', it will automatically default to it without giving you the option. By installing an older version that doesn't support the 'chat bubble' and opening a 'chat head', you skip this check and instead tell Messenger to start the background process to draw 'chat heads'. When you update the app, this check doesn't happen again and now you're using the older 'chat heads' instead of the newer system level 'chat bubbles'.

Hope this helps someone out there!",Android

"Samsung S21 Ultra - Good, Bad, Ugly","Used Samsung S21 ultra for over one month...  in simple words -  there is exterior good built qualities and many problems things that i struggle with.....

Talking about problems:

1) one thing samsung hasnt been able to fix is their heating issues... its been years and even now many time while phone is left idle (not using it and not on charging) its so hot to pickup... i informed Samsung support about it but looks like they aren't interested to look at it unless the phones start to blast like what we saw in past from Samsung.

2) Network - this is a basic function of a phone to allow you to make calls and receive calls. only in this phone, i have put the phone on flight mode and turn off flight mode before i can successfully make calls. also many people complaint that my phone is not reachable lately. - before you think its the network issue - its not because many people in my family using same network. staying in same house but with different phones do not face these issues. 

3) moving parts inside phone - its so much annoying that you can hear the noise almost every time you pickup the phone to make a call or anything else.... after some research i found this could be camera stabalizer - however samsung never informed or post on their web that this model will have the issue. its so much annoying. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good part:

1) it has great display quality and a decent battery backup.

2) camera quality is good, 100x is just a gimmick (pixels go crazy) but zoom is effective for 10x which is also good to cover distance.

3) quality of pen sensitivity is great - problem is there is no slot to keep s-pen in official covers - i got one which had no space/slot to keep the pen together.",Android

"Google apps, dark mode inconsistencies","I'll start off by saying, I love android, but damn sometimes it's not consistent, and I get that there are different teams working on different apps, but how hard is it for the highest up person to organize this shit by saying: all splash screens must be *this colour*, with status bars and navigation bars being the same colour. Once in the app, backdrop colour must be this colour, all secondary colours must be this colour, navigation bar backgrounds must be transparent, status bars must be the same colour as background colour or if tab bar is up top, must be the same as secondary colour.

Now let me begin lol:

Calculator splash screen uses the lighter grey splash screen hex: #2D3033 when it should use the darker #202124 to be consistent with the others as it's the backdrop colour.

Calendar splash screen uses a different light grey colour: #303030 when it should use #202124 to be consistent. 

Chrome: wtf is that navbar colour, with a light grey line separator, make it transparent so it's consistent with other apps.

Contacts splash screen has a flash of a black navigation bar..

Google drive splash screen has a flash of a black navigation bar..

Google files app, why is it's main colour black? It's inconsistent to every other app.

Gmail navigation bar should be transparent..

Google app main colour is #303134, nice inconsistency with other apps.

Google home app splash screen uses a different light grey colour: #303030 when it should use #202124 to be consistent. Also the splash screen and inside the app the navbar colour is a different colour and should be consistent with the bottom tab buttons background.

Google maps, weird as dark blue colour and black nav bar splash screen, still no dark mode..

Google phone, splash screen #303134 when it should be #202124, bottom tab button background is #303134 when it should blend with the bottom nav #202124

Youtube, splash screen is #303030 when it should be #202124, splash screen also has a different colour status bar and a black navigation bar. Once in the app you still have a black navigation bar, and a darker status bar, main theme colour of the app is #282828 when everything should be #202124

Google pay has a black nav bar on the splash screen and in the app.



Google, if you want to beat Apple at its own game, start with the consistency of your apps. Apple people buy Apple products because they look nice. Apple makes their apps consistent and designed well. That's one thing I'll give them credit for.",Android

We need to talk more about how Microsoft is absolutely smashing it on Android if you are a *corporate* microsoft365 user,"We tend to talk a lot on here about how android is used by members as *consumers* \- Microsoft has got a lot of praise for many of its apps like launcher but we don't talk much about how useful their software is if you are a corporate user.

So Office is pretty well understood but I'm not sure that many users understand how deep Microsoft Edge is hooked into the ecosystem.

Very briefly - if you are a corporate 365 user and sign in your work profile in edge - not only can you switch between profiles but being signed in means you can search and access corporate information directly from the browser and see files in use and so on.

I switched to Edge on both desktop and Android and boy is it saving me so much time on my android device.

Samsung Galaxy S10e VS Realme 7 Pro,"Background: I've been a loyal Samsung user since the release of the Samsung Galaxy S5 in 2014. I picked up the Samsung S10e in early 2020. I wanted a ""flagship"" experience and the S10e promised to offer that at a very competitive price. After a year of useage the battery life wanned significantly so I decided to pick up the Realme 7 Pro. I read numerous articles and watched several videos that claimed the 7 Pro was one of the best value propositions on the market with a number of high end specs at a mid-range price. Here's how the two stack up:

Samsung S10e:

-Far superior build quality. The Gorilla Glass 5 feels far superior to the plastic backing on the 7 Pro.

-Superior speaker quality. Calls and music simply sound clearer and more dynamic on the S10e.

-Superior tactical sensation. The haptic feedback on the S10e just feels right. The haptic feedback on the 7 Pro (especially just out the box) is ugly.

Realme 7 Pro:

-Far superior camera resolution. The S10e's measly 12MP simply doesn't stack up to the 7 Pro's 64MP. That's 433% higher resolution!

-Longer lasting battery. It's not surprising the 7 Pro's battery lasts longer (4500mAh vs. 3100mAh).

-Cheaper price. In most markets the 7 Pro can picked up for less than half the price of the Samsung.

CONCLUSION: 

The Realme Pro 7 suprisingly holds its own against a flagship device from the powerhouse that is Samsung. While it's certainly not as refined or feels anywhere near as high-end as the S10e it packs several features that are in fact better than the S10e (most notably the camera). At less than half the price I would say the Realme 7 Pro is the winner.",Android

Are Higher Resolution Phones A Waste Due to Distance?,"With the new switch Pro rumored to have an OLED and 720 display, a lot of people were upset that it's a lower resolution. 

However Jeff Grubb argues higher resolutions are a waste on these smaller displayers.

https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1367284061308284928

&gt;I'm begging you. Before you give your Switch Pro takes. Please look at the pixel density of 720p at 7 inches. It's 209 pixels per inch, which is equivalent to a Retina display if you hold it 16 inches away from your face, which you almost certainly do if you are an adult.

&gt;1080p in handheld is a waste of power -- both in terms of performance and battery. **Even on your phone, which probably has a super high resolution, games run at 720p** because you won't notice the difference, but you would notice your battery draining in 20 minutes.

**His second point about games running at a lower resolution is something I didn't know about.**

I know this isn't strictly related to android at all, but with the premium samsung phones lowering their displays from 1440p to 1080p, maybe it doesn't matter that much? Thoughts?",Android

I have switched from iPhone around Summer and never looked back until now. One of my main concerns for switching was how easy it is to make it Android more private than Apple, yet with time i realised that i could've been wrong all along. Yes, Apple collects quite much data about you, but it seems to be quite greedy with it, limiting other companies and leaving no chance for them to access the desired information.   


My question is, with the current privacy-oriented road that Apple has chosen, is it a better option for a user to stick with it, or are there some ways to make my Android device more secure?

Thoughts on the Galaxy Z Fold 2 as a first time foldable phone user,"Hey guys,

When the first Galaxy Fold was announced a couple of years ago, I was blown away as I wasn't expecting good foldables to come this soon. Then the reviews came and reality set in. I decided to wait for the second generation before buying one and seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews on the Z Fold 2 made me go ahead and buy one. Here are my thoughts on the Z Fold 2 after having it for a month.

[If you'd rather listen/watch, here's a video review](https://youtu.be/JS93Pcd00QA). As always, no ads.

## Initial Reaction

My first reaction was WOW holy shit this looks unreal. The first time you unfold the phone is quite magical. It shows how much this technology has matured in just a couple of years. The screen looks absolutely stunning when unfolded and the 120Hz refresh rate makes this phone really fly. The hinge is tight and feels quite assuring. It's got the perfect level of resistance to make you feel that it's not going to break. The glass finish makes it feel like an expensive showpiece. You think this is peak smartphone and if there's a thing as a perfect smartphone, this is it...

Then the reality starts to set in a bit. The phone's front screen, although nothing wrong with it is quite narrow. It's good for checking notifications, a bit of casual browsing, and making calls. But, it's quite bad when it comes to typing. I typically install the Google Keyboard on my phones but that keyboard just doesn't work well on this phone. The keys aren't meant for a screen this narrow or the bigger screen. Also, because both screen sizes are uncommon, most apps just aren't optimized for either screen. The front screen is too narrow and the main screen is too square-ish causing a lot of apps to have borders.

The primary screen, while it's stunning to take a look at, has a very thick plastic screen protector installed on it. It ends up making this amazing-looking piece of technology into a smudgy mess. Because it's plastic, it's pretty hard to keep clean and you have to spend some time cleaning it with a microfiber cloth. Samsung doesn't recommend removing it yourself and while the screen is made of glass, it's so thin I wouldn't dare removing the screen protector to prevent it from cracking.

## Durability Concerns

The phone isn't water or dust-resistant, and it's made of glass. That means, if you drop it, it's likely game over. Because the phone is so expensive to own, I ended up putting a case on it to keep it protected. As a result, this already chunky thicc boy looked like it put on some lockdown weight. As a result, I felt I didn't quite enjoy using it as a phone. When consuming media, it was an absolute joy, but the cheap-feeling plastic always reminded me that the tech wasn't mature enough every time I turned off the screen or played something dark on it.

## The Good Side

It might seem that I'm shitting on the phone, but that's not the case at all. Samsung deserves a lot of praise for everything they were able to pack into this device. The battery life is incredible and easily got me 6-7 hours of screen on time while primarily using the bigger screen. The cameras, while not top of the line, offer most focal lengths and take really good quality shots. While it doesn't have a microSD slot, the 256GB storage is more than enough for over 90% of people. Also, I like the software tweaks Samsung added to take advantage of the foldable form factor. You can seamlessly set most apps to switch between the cover and primary screen. You can use the front screen as a viewfinder to take selfies using the primary camera. And some apps like YouTube and camera give you a slightly different experience when the phone is partially folded.

## How to Improve It

Here's how I think the phone can be improved. First, instead of glass, I'd like to see Samsung use plastic or ""glasstic"" as they call it for the back. It'll not only reduce the fear of breaking this phone, but also significantly reduce the weight of the phone and hopefully lower the price. Also, I'd like to see a thinner, but wider body. This will fix two complaints. One, it'll make the front screen bigger and more useful, and second, it'll allow for a wider folded screen, which will only improve multitasking similar to the Microsoft Surface Duo, as currently, the screen is best for using one app at a time. Also, to reduce the weight further, I'd be curious to see a smaller battery paired with a low-power processor. If Samsung can deliver a smooth experience similar to the Pixel 5, most people won't even notice that this isn't using the latest and greatest internals. Also, all these changes will significantly reduce the price, making this revolutionary tech more accessible.

And obviously, I'd like to see a foldable glass screen that's durable enough to use without fear of it cracking easily and a hinge that's dust and water-resistant, but I'm not sure if that's doable at the moment.

For now, I think the Galaxy Z Fold 2 isn't the phone for me, but it has done its job to get me super excited for the future of this form factor. If you have a Z Fold 2, I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.",Android

No, not your face (you're a beautiful person!), the 16fps sad excuse for ""usable video"" coming out of your 2020 or 2021 cutting-edge, likely one thousand dollar device.

I'm an Android die-hard.  I'm an enthusiast.  A power-user.  A borderline apologist.  I've been trying to get this issue addressed for years.Fun Fact: An ex of mine had the first iOS device with a front camera.  An iPhone 4 in 2010.  It always, in any app, had a full and flawless 30fps in any lighting condition.  All iPhones can.

We are over a full decade behind the iPhone in this regard.

**How can I test this on my phone?**

1. Enter a dimly lit room.  Most indoor lighting is dim enough for this test, even in daytime.
2. Launch a 3rd party app that takes front video, I'll use Facebook as an example.
3. Create A Story
4. Tap the camera icon in the bottom right
5. Switch to the front camera and select Video
6. Take a video, and when you are done, tap Save
7. Launch VLC, and select Browse in the bottom nav bar
8. Select Storage, then Pictures, then Facebook
9. Tap the triple-dot icon to the right of your file, and choose informationIn most cases, you will see the frame rate is 16.0-16.67 fps

**Why is this happening?**

I'm not a developer so I'm not sure.  From what I understand about Android is that there's a mix of issues here:

1. Shitty Camera APIs within Android from Google for camera access
2. Shitty camera hardware from OEMs in Android devices
3. Shitty firmware from what could be good camera hardware from OEMs in Android devices
4. Shitty API support and management from Android devs in their apps
5. A heady brew of 1-4

Since I'm not a developer, I can't narrow it down any further than that.  It seems to be mostly #1, and #3.  My last few devices, the Oneplus 2, Oneplus 3T and Oneplus 6T can take proper video using the built-in camera app, but ***NEVER*** low-light 30fps in 3rd party camera apps.  So the hardware is not bad, otherwise the built-in camera app would do this as well.  Something on the firmware, OS or app side is causing this.  I've tested this on other devices as well, mostly in the Samsung and LG spaces, they also get low fps in 3rd party apps.  I also understand that this may have something to do with Camera2 API support.  Back cams tend not to do this with 3rd party video apps if the back cam has FULL or LEVEL\_3 support, which is uncommon on device front cams.  Even the mighty Pixel 5, considered to be one of the kings of smartphone camera, cannot and will not hit 30fps front video in low light using these apps.  It's had the same camera hardware since what, 2016?  Logic would say that there should had been plenty of time to figure this out on the software end.  But no.

**What can we do about it?**

I really don't know.  But it needs to start with making a TON of noise.  Tweet/comment/message OEMs.  And Google.  And your favorite tech review.  And app devs.  Let them know this makes a difference to you. Leave reviews outlining this issue.  Point back to this post maybe.  I've been barking about this for a few years now and the most common response I get is that users either don't care, or don't use the feature enough.  It's 2021 and we're still social distancing in a midst of a pandemic that has no end in sight.  ***This matters.***  Don't wait on CameraX because neither devs nor OEMs are under any obligation to use it.  Chances are your 2020 device doesn't have proper Camera2 support for its front cam, and Camera2 came out with Lollipop in 2014.

**I tried your test, and in 3rd party camera apps, my front cam gets 30fps in low light.**

We need better bootloop practices,"When Microsoft and Intel (plus so many others) headed the secure bootloader requirement on PCs there was a huge outcry from users. (1)  Since that time, I haven’t seen anyone who has an easy to fix but bricked PC.   
Why is this different on Android? I think it would be reasonable to require explicit permissions from users to unlock bootlock for “modifications”, but why do we need to wait for benevolent hackers to find vulnerabilities in our phones, so that we can reflash the original ROMs when we are stuck on bootloop (2)

I have a Xiaomi Mi A1 phone that is stuck on booting. Normally I should be able to reset the OS, or just reflash a ROM, but since I haven’t anticipated bootlocker being in such a state, I haven’t created any Mi account and explicitly synced my phone with Xiaomi Unlock service, which I haven’t heard until my problem (no mention for it on user manual, or on software update notifications)

3 Samsung Tips/Tricks you might not know,"If you haven't already, spend some time and dig through all your settings if you own a Samsung device (or any other for that matter). You've probably heard of the Good Lock apps suite, but this post is going to list some stuff you might not know
  
**1** 

Dual Messenger but with almost any app (Settings -&gt; Advanced Features)

If you weren't aware, Dual Messenger lets you create a clone of a messenging app so you can sign into a second account. Unfortunately, the list of supported apps is small. A possible workaround is just using Secure Folder, but they took away the ability to add Secure Folder app shortcuts on your homescreen/app drawer. Fortunately, you can just use adb to install almost any app you want.

If you don't already have an app enabled for Dual Messenger, you're going to need to do that first. Now run the following commands:

    adb shell pm list users

You'll get a few outputs, the one you want to focus on is the user that mentions Dual App. Here's an example of an output:

    UserInfo{95:DUAL_APP:20000030} running

Take note of the number that preceeds ""DUAL_APP"", in this case, 95

Now exit the shell (by typing exit)

Download or extract the desired apk, copy the file to the folder containing adb, and run the following command:

    adb install --user 95 &lt;apk filename&gt;.apk

With this workaround, you will have to manually grant permissions using the built in permission manager (the [one](https://i.imgur.com/lIF30jt.jpg) that lists all the permissions as well as which apps are allowed/denied). From a specific permission for the app you just installed, you can tweak all of the permissions by following the ""See all &lt;app name&gt; Permissions"" option

I'm not 100% sure how updates are handled, so you'll need to see if the cloned app is updated together with the original, or if you need to pull out adb to update the cloned app
  
**2** 

Call and Message Continuity with 2 phones instead of phone and tablet (Settings -&gt; Advanced Features -&gt; Call and text on other devices)

Note: You may need both devices to be on Android 10 for this to work properly

So this feature lets you sync calls and texts over WiFi/Data with a supported phone and tablet, letting you call or text on the tablet. If you have two supported phones and want to sync calls and texts between them, it's just one adb command away. On the device you want the calls and texting functionality, run the following command:

    adb shell settings put global cmc_device_type sd

Now just run the setup process with both phones
  
**3** 

Galaxy Labs

Galaxy Labs is an experimental suite of apps that provide added functionality, similar to Good Lock. It was recently updated with two new modules, Thermal Guardian and Memory Guardian.  As far as I know, you need a device with One UI 3.x for these two new modules.

Thermal Guardian lets you adjust the temperature at which your phone starts to throttle. It also monitors the temperature of your device and displays it on a graph, so you can view when your phone got warm/hot and why (it tells you what was responsible)

Memory Guardian lets you view detailed RAM usage information, including how much RAM is being consumed exactly per app. It also lets you clear apps from memory.

There are 4 other modules that are supported for devices on One UI 2.x:

File Guardian (lets you restore deleted items, not useful since a trash function exists in the My Files app)

Battery Guardian (basically Device Care but with a few extra options for users with One UI 3.x)

Battery Tracker (very detailed battery usage stats)

App Booster (optimizes all apps on your device for better performance. It apparently uses the Dex2Oat compiler for all of your apps)

Chances are, you won't find these apps in the Galaxy Store, so you'll need to sideload them individually (APKMirror is a good place to grab them). Make sure to install Galaxy Labs Agent in addition to your desired apps + Galaxy Labs",Android

"Correction: S21 haptics are excellent, but would be improved by moving actuator location","I previously briefly tried out the S21 phones in a store and made a post saying that they felt weaker than previous models; you can read that post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/l0x3mb/s21_haptics_downgraded/). I got some feedback from people more familiar with Samsung phones than me and I have since received my S21 Ultra (I got navy so it took a long time). I can now say that the haptics are actually excellent once you increase the vibration intensity in settings. Additionally, the Samsung keyboard is lower intensity than Gboard. The haptics are stronger at the top of the phone, so I do think it would be an improvement to move it down towards the bottom where you're typing and swiping and holding the phone, and I think this is the reason that the Note 20 felt stronger to me when I tried them side-by-side. And it does have haptic feedback when moving the cursor, which I couldn't feel in the store with the intensity turned down. But I'm most impressed by settings sliders (not just in Samsung apps but also in Google and others), which when you tap on them feel like the slider is moving across the phone, and turning on vibrate ring mode feels like what Nintendo described with the ice cubes shaking in their Joy-Con controllers when they first showed them off in a video. This is a huge improvement over the linear actuator in my Pixel 2 XL. It's tight, strong after adjusting the settings, and Samsung's software implementation with the various different effects adds a lot to the experience for me (perhaps these were created by Cirrus Logic, who makes the haptic hardware, but I don't know if any other Android phones are implementing these vibration profiles for toggles, etc).",Android

Interesting Nearby Share trick I found by accident...,"So I haven't been able to find anything online about this (at least from a quick search), but if you tap two androids (with NFC) together while Nearby Share is open on one, it instantly opens it on the other and connects the two, only prompting to accept the file. Sorta Android Beam, I guess. Pin it to your share sheet (if you can) and it's just about as fast.

This only works if the device that is sharing is already ""Looking for devices"", but the ""Someone is sharing nearby"" notification doesn't need to appear on the target for this to work. The pickup on the NFC seems more sensitive than Android Beam, sometimes pairing Nearby Share when the phones are just flat on a table next to each other. This could just be the offset NFC point on my Xperia 1, though.

OnePlus 7 Pro vs Galaxy S21 Ultra (longish),"I made this switch recently and wanted to share my thoughts for anyone who might be considering it.

My 7 Pro is very close to my perfect phone. The reasons I decided to upgrade were, in decreasing order of importance:

- battery life had recently become much worse. I baby the batteries on phones as much as possible, charging to 87% or less unless I'm going to be away from a charger for a long time, never going below 25%, disabling the FB app and accessing it by browser only, etc. This kept my 5t's battery in perfect shape for years, I still had 7+ hours SOT with it when I retired it. Still, over the last couple of months my SOT dropped by 30-40% on my 7 Pro.

- I've been doing more and more outdoorsy stuff and wanted a better camera

- I have a lot of microscratches on the screen caused by debit/credit cards in my wallet case. Once I noticed them I took the cards out but it's pretty annoying that plastic cards can scratch Gorilla Glass. There are 3 horizontal lines of microscratches that you can't see on bright content but you can on dark content

- The phone has gotten a bit stuttery at times. Nothing major but sometimes the notification shade will get stuck in the down position and I have to turn off the screen with the power button and turn it back on to reset it. Or app switching will be a bit laggy. I'm not a power user by any means and I'm not running intensive apps but it definitely feels slower than it did a year ago.

- I feel like OnePlus phones don't get a lot of or consistent updates

So, I decided to go with the S21 Ultra as it is very similar to the 7 Pro:

- almost identical screen size

- high res + high refresh rate oled

- in-screen fingerprint sensor

- all of the above + better cameras, giant battery, s-pen support, the aura of actually owning a true high end phone vs ""best bang for the buck"" mid-range phone which I've always gone for in the past

How do they stack up? Things the S21 Ultra does better:

- the 10x zoom camera is amazing and overall camera performance is just better. Sometimes by a little, sometimes by a lot. With one exception (listed below)

- screen is better. The 7 Pro screen is very very nice but side by side the Samsung wins. Whites on the 7 Pro are slightly yellow, greys have a bit of brown. To be fair, you'd never notice on its own, only if the two are directly compared.

- Samsung has a ton of bloat and software but some of it is really useful. One-handed mode is great, side-tray is great, their camera app has so many options as to be almost overwhelming but really gives you the ability to get the most out of the cameras with tons of features.

- it is definitely faster, even for a non-gamer. 

- big ol' battery that lasts a long time, helped by the variable refresh rate among other things

- brighter screen in sunlight

Things that are different but equal between the two:

- they both feel great in hand, but very different. The OnePlus is more curvy and slippery but the glass back looks and feels amazing. The flatter surfaces on the Samsung also feel great and it's less slippery. I use a case so not a big deal either way.

- the pop up camera is very nice on the OnePlus to maximize screen space and give you that bit of reassurance re: privacy, the Samsung will face-unlock faster and, while I was skeptical, it's true that you never really notice the tiny camera cutout even while watching videos

Things the OnePlus 7 Pro does better:

- I really, really miss the ring / vibrate / silent toggle switch. Most underrated feature on OnePlus phones. 

- Night mode shots are definitively better. Much better detail and sharpness, Samsung's are a blurry mess (but more accurate colors).

- fingerprint sensor is more reliable on the OnePlus. I do the trick where I train one finger multiple times and the OnePlus is again definitively better. To be fair, I used to have problems with the OnePlus and retrained my print several times but over the last 6 months or so it was flawless, worked as well as one would ever hope for. Maybe I need to keep retraining the Samsung and it will get to that point.

- faster charging on the OnePlus. I bought the 25 watt charger for the Samsung and it's not as fast as the OnePlus warp charge. This is another feature I really miss.

Overall, they are very very close. I wanted to try a real flagship and, if only because of the cameras, I would say that the Samsung is the ""better"" phone. My ideal phone would by a 7 Pro with the Samsung zoom cameras, screen, and battery, and at a price point somewhere between the two devices. Is the Samsung worth 2x the price? I don't think so but it's nice. I'm waiting for the s-pen pro later this year and that will probably help the Samsung's value proposition.

Why don't Android tablets use ChromeOS?,"I own both and have a fair bit of tablets under me, but now I can finally see the stark difference between the two now since I own a chromebook as well. It is clear that Android is not really optimised for larger screen like tablet anymore, that's why my last memorable tablet is a Tab S 10.5 and I do not see any reason to buy one too .

IMO, Android tablet is just an oversized phone with no real benefits in productivity at all. It doesn't provide any improvement from a phone, besides larger screen. 

On the other hand, Chromebook is far more superior in everything compared to a tablet. ChromeOS can do what any other tablet can do, but not vice versa. 

But why not many manufacturers push for ChromeOS for its tablets OS? I mean it can run on ARM, it is not resource heavy. I am perfectly happy with my Lenovo N23 Yoga. It is by any mean not a performance oriented chromebook at all and it runs on a Mediatek ARM. But the performance is more than acceptable than it is on a cheap $200 ish Android tablet.

"Cost of Android updates per year (cost of phones per year of security updates, from today)","I've been looking for a phone with long (assured) security updates and decided to make a little table, including some recently released Pixel and Android One phones (3 years of security updates). The price the used price based on a quick ebay UK search, that seemed the fairest to use (and relevant to me).

Pixel times are taken from [Google](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en-GB), Android One assumes 3 years updates and Wikipedia [release dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_One). I also threw in a few iPhones for comparison assuming 5 years of support. I divide the price today by the amount of months left until end of life. The product selection doesn't include many large phones because I don't like them, feel free to add your own :P

"SCAM: H96 MAX X4 ""S905X4"" ""Android 10"" Aliexpress TV Box misadventure","Original post for context since I couldn't crosspost it on here: https://old.reddit.com/r/AV1/comments/lq2xz3/scam_h96_max_x4_s905x4_android_10_aliexpress_tv/

So, I don't post here very often in this way, but what I found is truly horrible. This might seem like it's a bit of an overreaction, but I don't think it is.

I have sad news: the Aliexpress ""S905X4"" H96 MAX X4 Android TV box I ordered a month ago is actually not using the S905X4 SOC, and thus, does not support any sort of AV1 hardware decoding, contrary to what I was led to believe by the specifications listed and the pictures. This is rather surprising too, as I haven't had this issue with Android stuff ordered from Aliexpress before. I'm also surprised it's also been able to falsify the Android information, but there is a simple way around this, so I've been able to dig deeper.

How do I know? Well, I have these lovely pictures here... https://slow.pics/c/PCbYUpSr

Essentially, the CPU runs at a max of 1,9GHz. The S905X4 runs at a max of 2,0GHz. The S905X3 runs at a max of 1,9GHz.

The r1p0 codename indicates that an S905X3 is being used. I can therefore 100% confirm that the SOC used is an S905X3, and not an S905X4. Another proof is that I can't decode anything worth a damn above 480p 10-bit, and HW decoding in mpv-android, latest mpv-android, VLC Beta, and lots of other open source players only have HW VP9 and HEVC decoding.

Also, the API used for the Android TV box is 28. API 28 is Android 9 lol. I would also like to add that this ""Android 10"" TV box has a security patch in August of 2018, one whole year before Android 10 rolled around.

All in all, I am ultra pissed at these scammers, these god damn scammers got me hard. I am angry. I am furious. I will make them pay for what they've done.

TLDR: Any H96 MAX X4 S905X4 Android 10 TV box does not use the S905X4 on Android 10. Rather, it's an expensive Android 9 S905X3 TV box with nothing to decode AV1 with. This is a HUGE SCAM, AND I HOPE NOBODY EVER GETS SCAMMED BY THIS EVER AGAIN.

Advertisers are starting to abuse the background music in Chrome feature. (Bug needs immediate attention Google!),"My wife was on Nookazon looking to trade for some items and she turned her screen off and put the phone down.  About 15 seconds later, we heard an ad for some movie coming out in the near future. I looked at the phone thinking she left her screen on - she didn’t... The phone showed the “music” notification and showed Nookazon as playing an ad. I hit the pause button and turned the screen off - about a minute and a half later, a new ad queued up and started playing. 

This needs to be addressed immediately before advertisers get even smarter. Perhaps a simple prompt: “This site is playing music, do you want it to continue in the background?""

Edit:

I shouldn't have written Bug in the title - it's an abuse of a feature. So effectively, this is a Design Change Request. Regardless, this needs to be addressed ASAHP otherwise you'll have advertisers abuse this (like they already are on Nookazon).

For anyone who can't repo, specifically try that site. If it doesn't work after a minute or two, try letting your screen time out after refreshing. If you still can't repro it, it may be helpful to the engineer who will eventually review this if you leave your phone model and country. So far it's confirmed on Pixel 1 through 4.

I've used every Pixel phone. Here are my thoughts on the Pixel 5 after a few months of use.,"Hey guys,

So I've had the privilege to own every Pixel flagship device and I've loved every iteration despite the quirks. When the Pixel 5 was announced, I was a bit mixed on Google's decision to use midrange specs.

On paper, if you compare specs, the Pixel 5 seems worse than the Pixel 4XL. It's got a lower resolution screen, an inferior processor and GPU, no neural core chip for faster image processing, and a body covered in a material that feels more like plastic than metal.

Despite my assumptions, I decided to give it a fair chance. So, after using the phone for a few months, here are my thoughts on the Pixel 5.

(If you'd rather listen/watch, [here's a video version of this review.](https://youtu.be/huWyh19a9Ww) No ads.)

## Performance

The Pixel 5 has, what many may call, a midrange processor and GPU. Based on benchmarks, it's closer to the Pixel 3 when it comes to raw performance.

However, when it comes to real-world usage, it's pretty much impossible to tell that the phone is running on a mid-range processor. The phone runs very smoothly and handles pretty every task without any stutters. I must say that I don't game on my phone, so the experience might be a bit different for people who game a lot. The 8 gigs of RAM made sure apps didn't have to reload often and the fast refresh rate of the screen made for a very pleasant experience.

If I were to nitpick, I'd say the only time I noticed the phone didn't have flagship specs was when I took a bunch of photos and had to wait for the photos to process. To be honest, it's not something most people would notice.

I do have concerns about the long-term performance of the phone though. Right now, it's running flawlessly, but as apps get more demanding over time, the phone has the potential to be worse than the phones with high-end processors.

## Design

As someone who prefers smaller phones, I love the Pixel 5. It's very light and super comfortable to hold. The size is great for one-handed use. Size-wise, it's close to the iPhone 11 Pro, but thinner and much lighter.

In terms of materials, the phone's back is made from recycled aluminum with cutouts for wireless charging. In terms of durability, it's fantastic as I don't have to worry about cracking the back. But it comes to in-hand feel, it doesn't feel like metal because of the bio-resin coating Google has on it. So, if you associate quality with the cold feeling of metal and glass, you might think it doesn't feel as premium and that's a fair critique. I wish Google went for brushed aluminum like the first Pixel or HTC M7/M8.

I don't mind it at this price because the pros outweigh the cons in my opinion. Also, I like how grippy the phone is due to the bio-resin texture. It won't slip out of your hands easily.

## Screen

The screen is absolutely beautiful. The resolution has downgraded to 1080p though, but due to the smaller size, I can't tell the difference. It looks plenty sharp and there's no pixelation.

Also, this is one of the only phones with perfectly symmetrical bezels. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but I appreciate that attention to detail.

The 90hz refresh rate is great. It makes everything look fluid and I think that feature alone is worth it over the Pixel 4a XL. As I mentioned in my [Note 20 review](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNote20/comments/iw4a5q/honest_thoughts_on_the_note_20_ultra_after_3_weeks/), the difference between 60hz and 90hz is significant, but not that much between 90hz and 120hz. So, most users would be pretty happy with the 90hz refresh rate.

It's not all perfect though. Auto brightness on this phone isn't great. Sometimes it lowers the brightness for no reason, which forces me to manually adjust the brightness.

## Battery

One of the biggest reasons to get the Pixel 5 is the battery life. This is easily the longest-lasting Pixel flagship in my experience. I can easily go a full day with this and not worry about charging. The Pixel 4XL in comparison barely made it to the end of the day.

In terms of screen on time, I'm consistently getting around 6 hours on a full day of use with a bunch of standby time baked in. I'm currently daily driving the S21 Ultra and I'd say the battery life of the Pixel 5 is very close to the S21 Ultra, which is amazing.

## Camera

The camera is the one thing I'm slightly disappointed by this year. Don't get me wrong. It's still one of the best cameras out there, but it's pretty much the same camera as the Pixel 4 line. Google has been using the same sensor since the Pixel 3 and improvements have only been incremental since then.

The Pixel phones have been popular because of the camera quality and I think Google is starting to lose that advantage. In terms of quality, I'd rank it at #3.

I do appreciate that Google added a wide-angle camera this time. But it's not as wide as what you get on a Galaxy or iPhone. I'd love to see an even wider wide-angle and a dedicated zoom camera in the next Pixel.

The new software features are also helpful this time. For example, I like that I no longer need to get into Night Sight each time when needed. It automatically switches to it similar to Apple. For those who don't like it, Google has now added the option to turn it off. Also, Google has added the ability to take portrait shots with Night Sight, which is pretty sweet.

And while the front camera placement is aesthetically pleasing, it's not the best place to put it for usability reasons. You have to retrain yourself to hold the phone to your side instead of the centre if you want to take a symmetrical selfie.

## Sensors

There's no face unlock this time. I think the Pixel 4XL face unlock was just as good as iPhones. But, in a pandemic hit world, fingerprint is better than face unlock in my opinion. The placement is great and the circular design provides a big enough surface area. It works flawlessly and it's incredibly fast. In my experience, it works way better than the S21 Ultra.

Google removed a couple of sensors this time. First, there's no Soli, which I don't mind. I don't think it was implemented well on the Pixel 4XL. The technology is quite interesting, so I hope Google brings it back at some point when it's better.

And no squeeze functionality for the Assistant. Although I rarely used it, it was good to have for fast access to the assistant. The gesture replacement isn't that good.

## Speakers

When the phone came out, most reviewers bashed the speakers. So I was expecting the speakers to be horrible. To be honest, they're not as bad as the reviews made me believe. I've had no issues taking calls or watching content. Yes, when comparing side by side with iPhone or Galaxy phones, you can tell the sound isn't as rich, but it's not nearly as bad. Also, the update in December improved the quality with adaptive sound.

## Haptics

My last point is on the haptics. The vibration motor isn't as good as the 4XL or the iPhones. The iPhones are the gold standard and no Android phone comes close. I think the Pixel 4XL had one of the better vibration motors, so it was a bit sad to see the motor wasn't that good on the Pixel 5. It might not be big deal to you, but I think a good vibration motor makes a big difference. I hope Google improves it in the next generation.

## Worth it?

Overall, I think the Pixel 5 is the most well-rounded phone Google has made. The price, while slightly higher than I'd like is not too bad and the user experience is flagship level despite the mid-range specs.

If you have a Pixel 4, I don't recommend getting it unless you want a better battery. But if you have an older Pixel, I think it's a pretty good buy.",Android
New Lawnchair builds are up in their Telegram!,"You can find the builds in their Telegram, can't post the link because reddit thinks is spam 

@lawnchairci

I'll post the announcement below:

As we work towards a release with the latest Launcher3 at its core, we’re thrilled to share with you updates to the two existing major versions of Lawnchair.

But first, we’re introducing a new versioning scheme. The major version number reflects the Android release whose home app version a build is based on. For example, the major version of Lawnchair based on Launcher3 from Android 10 is called Lawnchair 10. And we call our next major release Lawnchair 11. We hope you enjoy today’s builds!

Lawnchair 9.1 Alpha 2 addresses an issue with At a Glance where adding calendar events as a data source would show the weather instead.

Lawnchair 10.0 Alpha 8:
• Addresses an issue with At a Glance where adding calendar events as a data source would show the weather instead.
• Resolves crashes on Android 11.
• Introduces the Android 11 app closing animation on devices with a recent version of Launcher3 installed.

As you know, our founder – Tillie Kottmann – will no longer be leading Lawnchair. This is a good opportunity to express our gratitude.

Edit: now let's see what the people bashing Nova because of the new animations are gonna say now that Lawnchair added exactly the same :)",Android
"Does anyone else wish the modern day smartphone focused on being a good, well... Phone?","All these fantastic devices coming out. We have monster powerhouses of technology literally in our pockets, and it feels like the actual main ""communication"" aspect of these devices seem to be, in my opinion, an after thought.

It'd be nice to see super high quality microphones and speakers in these $1k+ devices and not just ""call quality is good"" level of expectations.

Arguably, texting and social media are primary focal points of communication in this day in age, but when you buy a phone, especially one that costs such an extraordinary amount of money nowadays, I want to hear voices and my voice to be heard at the same level of quality that everything else is in these phones. 

It really does feel like the actual ""phone"" part of it is an after thought. I made a phone call today on my OnePlus 7 Pro to a buddy of mine who has the S21 Ultra, and it was that conversation that got me wanting to make this post. I feel like in 2021, technology has progressed enough that phone calls shouldn't sound ""tinny"" or ""radio"" like. Microphones and speakers are good enough nowadays that you can get these things to produce sound that make it feel like they're right next to you, even in small packages.

I mean, look at what they've been able to do with ear buds. Sound quality is fantastic in something like my Galaxy Buds + and my Sony wf1000xm3's, but the mics are still shit on all of them.

I want a phone and ear bud combo that give not only me a good experience listening, but the listener a good experience as well.

EDIT: Thank you everybody for all of your input! I think the strong majority believe that the issue comes down to the network limitations, which in all honesty, makes perfect sense. I had never, for some reason, thought of this, and just blamed it on hardware. 

Looks like I might be investing into some Jabra ear buds, and I've also gone ahead with the purchase of a Pixel 5. Being in Google Fi, something tells me my experience will improve by using a device designed for the network. 

Again, thanks for all the input, and awesome conversation!",Android

Possible fix for autocorrect issues on Android,"Hey y'all, if you're experiencing constant autocorrect issues on Android I may have a small solution for you I was unaware of. 

I have a Samsung phone and since switching from my Pixel I've had a lot of issues typing on most keyboards. 

I've noticed that gboard and swiftkey now have this weird issue where they instead of correcting a misspelled word, it adds it to its learned words list.

Since this I've had this issue I've taken to wiping my gboard history weekly to unlearn all these bad spellings as there isn't a selective removal. It's all or nothing. 

While doing my weekly gboard wipe I noticed an option I didn't pay a lot of attention to under the gboard settings menu: 

**Text Correction** &gt; **System Spell Checker Settings** &gt;  **Default Spell Checker** &gt; **Gboard Spell Checker**.

The system autocorrect engine I've been using this whole time was for the Samsung keyboard which in my personal use has been shit. I didn't realize that the Samsung spell checker overides the Google one and has been causing my issues. Possibly even with Swift Key which I'll have to try again to test my theory.

Find my device for rooted phones,"Rewriting the entire post to make it more comprehensive:  The setup will probably take much less time than reading this lengthy ass post lol.

I am on android 11, lineageOs 18.1, snapdragon 855+, 12 + 256gb Realme x2 pro, Magisk 21.4 Canary.

**Note:** I am not a developer, i know jack shit about making apps etc, just found something cool to share so here it is.

1. Find my device on samsung and apple good, if you own, ignore this post
2. Google find my device for remaining android users bad because it only works if data + gps on; No way to switch on remotely.
3. Random find my device apps inconsistent, may collect data, doesn't work well on android 10+ in my experience, don't waste your time, download  an app called macrodroid (Clean, intuitive, freemium task automater)
4. Use macrodroid to make your own find my device macro, usually takes 15 mins to make + test.

**Note:**

1. If airplane mode was on when you lost your phone, you can't do anything until its switched it off.
2. Nothing can prevent a hard shutdown. If the thief does that its over.
3. Its also over if they remove your sim card. (If anyone has phone imei trackers please do comment)Now its time to tell you about potential problems and failsafes if your phone is in somebody else's hands.

**1.** They will try to shut down your phone:

**Solution**: To prevent people from shutting down your phone, download  **Lock screen protector** or **Smart Lockscreen Protector.**  If you try to shut down your phone on the lock screen, it shows the shutdown menu for like a second and makes it disappear. *However if you are fast enough you can shut it down by touching the area where the shutdown logo appears.*

Some devices, like mine, can't disable the pull down menu from settings. To fix this, get Get Riru EdXposed on your device. Download this module from this link: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/fjlozayhutsars3/NoQSInLockScreen-P4Mod\_1.0-Q.apk/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/fjlozayhutsars3/NoQSInLockScreen-P4Mod_1.0-Q.apk/file)

Flash it and enable it through the edxposed manager. It works perfectly.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.** They can reduce the notification and ringer volumes from the lockscreen to prevent the device from ringing:

**Solution:** The app  is called **volume lock**  Once you set a volume and lock it through the app, it can't be changed from anywhere apart from the app. Since macrodroid uses the **notification** volume for playing media, **put your notification volume to max and lock it.** Havin max noti volume c*an get to be a pain in the ass at times.*

Now to setup macrodroid: Please give it all required admin permissions and root access and enter the macrowizard.

**TRIGGERS:**

The Red Box is the triggers section and we want to add 2 triggers:

1. If an SMS is sent with our keyword

**How to Setup:**  Triggers ---&gt; Call/Sms subsection --&gt; Sms received --&gt; Select contacts ---&gt; Matches ---&gt; ""find phone"" (or whatever keyword you want to use to trigger the app remotely)

2. If 2 failed passcode attempts are made (Or how many ever you want, up to you).

**How to setup:** Device Events subsection----&gt; Failed login attempt ---&gt; 2 failures within 1 minute.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to Setup what happens once the triggers go off:  Ill mention only the subsections where you can find the actions instead of the whole thing. Its pretty easy to setup after that, just go along with it.  subsections are in caps

Shift over to the blue box called actions:

1. **Display a dialog on your lockscreen** under the  **NOTIFICATION subsection.**
2. **Volume change**  under **VOLUME**
3. **launch application under**  **APPLICATIONS**. (You want to launch the volume lock app that we installed before).
4. Play media under **MEDIA  (this one is important so that you can physically hear your phone when it starts ringing,  I put a unique identifiable song that i can't mistake for a notification)**
5. These are all seperate actions but they all come under the **CONNECTIVITY** subsection, so do them one by one: airplane mode ON/off (turn it off), Bluetooth conifgure (turn it on), Wifi configure: (Turn it on)
6. Under LOCATION: Enable All 5 actions under it and share the location to a number or email, upto you.
7. Take picture under CAMERA/PHOTO subsection.
8. Save your macro.
9. Test the macro, you are done :)
10. Bunch of other juicy stuff you can do, so explore  the  app  at leisure after you have followed my steps. Think a real scenario through and if you find something i missed pls post it, i'd love to hear from you :)",Android

I hope Android 12's new theming system allows for a complete AMOLED dark mode system wide,"When I say this, I mean in Google apps. I don't know why Google decided to make its own apps have a gray mode but it's pretty ugly. 

It'd be better if Google made a darker gray-ish blue color but this light gray color looks pretty ugly and I hate it. It's also very inconsistent. In Google Docs, the dark mode is completely black inside a document. 

I want a better dark mode in Android 12 with the new theming.

Edit: people are talking about smearing and stuff. I get that which is why I presented the alternative of a better gray mode. It doesn't even have to be completely dark but just something better. 

The light gray looks hideous to me and is a total eye sore, some users have expressed the same. I get that some of you don't want this, which is why I'm hopeful for a better theming system so we get to pick. The gray makes it difficult at times. Apps like Google's Messaging look really good in light mode but just horrible in dark mode and when there's new messages, that bold white just makes it look so voluminous and difficult to read.

As for people talking about contrast and ease of reading, I personally find it a lot easier to read when it's in AMOLED dark mode. For example reddit has amoled dark mode, to me it looks a lot better and easier to read and I prefer it. But Gmail and other text heavy Google apps are more difficult to read",Android

I put together a rough look at the relative single core performance of the main Snapdragon SOC's of the last 8 or so years,"My Pixel is ageing a bit so I was looking at alternatives. I was wondering how budget SOC's in 2020 compared to a flagship from a few years ago So I put together this:

https://i.imgur.com/bMgzL00.png

I just aggregated Geekbench Single Core benchmark data for all the different devices with that SOC and averaged a value for it. There wasn't a lot of data available for the 888 so that's a bit of an estimate.

Obviously it's all very high level and only SC and only one software so please don't spam the comments saying this is useless. I just thought it was interesting to see for example that a mid-range SOC from 2019 beats out the top of the lice processor from 2016. Or that the absolute cheapest stuff available now is better than flagships which had the 800/801 like the Nexus 5 or something.

Here is the raw data as a .csv if anyone wants to play around with it: https://pastebin.com/iTBM8nhJ

PSA: Android 11 now fully supports gesture navigation for Nova launcher (and maybe other third-party launchers?),"A year ago I remember having to choose between Nova launcher and using side swipe for back button. I chose Nova then (mostly because I purchased the premium and some icons), and gave in with a swipe-from-bottom-only navigation.

Last week my Note 10+ finally landed its major update and I'm so happy to find out my favorite swipe gestures are now back, from both bottom AND sides.

Check that out guys.

Things I'd like to see in future releases of Android!,"1. Gestures to work better with third party launchers.
2. I recently came across an app called [Bottom Quick Settings](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tombayley.bottomquicksettings) and found it extremely useful. The notification shade is at the bottom of the screen which makes for easier one handed use. I'd like Google to implement this in Android and maybe a swipe from the top could be used for something else (I'm thinking cards and passes, smart devices controls and maybe Nearby Share requests and media sessions).
3. \[This one is very debatable\] I'd like to Google to encourage all app developers to use Material Design in their apps. It makes the apps fit in more with the general look of the rest of the OS.
4. I really want to be able to create custom notification categories in the notification shade. For example, I can create a 'News' category and add Google News and other news app's news notifications into that category. Or I could have a 'Shopping' category where I can add Amazon product shipping update notifications.
5. Blocking apps from using certain permissions when the screen is off. This would greatly improve standby battery drain.
6. An indication of which apps are using the camera and/or microphone.
7. A bluetooth battery widget for connected bluetooth devices.
8. Scrolling screenshots

P.S. This is just my opinion, it may or may not be similar to yours. I'd like to hear what you think.

Samsung Galaxy A52: New version of the best-selling smartphone,,Android
(OC) Camera Comp - S21 ULTRA vs PIXEL 3a XL - David vs Goliath?,"Guys, I'm not an expert on tech. I'm somewhere between average Joe and enthusiast. I take quite a few pictures, mostly of people and my dogs and a few beautiful landscapes here and there. I've never posted something like this but the results were too strange not to share. 


Lots of reviewers have been saying that the Pixel has lost its edge, and that the newest flagships are competing with and/or beating it. Lo and Behold, my mother buys the new S21 Ultra I told her not to buy, and I get to personally stack up pixel tech vs the latest and greatest. And honestly? I thought the S21U would give my phone a run for it's money or maybe best it. But 90% of the photos I took, the pixel 3a XL outclassed it! I think I missed some of the S21 Ultra's strong suits, telephotos, video, and landscapes, but in the photos I took, I was disappointed with its output.

The indoor shots were taken in moderate indoor lighting. My house isn't super bright but I wouldn't call it dim. 

The 21 Ultra had a host of problems. It recognizes people and dogs (? moving subjects at least) and tries to manipulate the image and ends up making a terrible shot. My dog Tripp comes out very soft, the HDR is way overdone, and they all have a yellow hue which was not there. The pixel captures some great shots - true to life and color. 

My mom (holding my firstborn 😁) looks great on the pixel. On the Ultra, it does this silly smoothing on her face, it also smoothes her hair on accident, she comes out very soft, and again with the unnatural hue. The flyaways in her hair have been disappeared by image processing. The HDR makes the whole photo flat. In the portrait modes, my son's head looks like it was cut out by a 10 year old in photoshop.

The picture of the flowers was bright and crisp. The picture of my backyard was crisp. I don't like the unnatural brightening and colors of everything, but at least there weren't any people in the viewfinder for the S21 Ultra to mangle. I think the S21 U's strong suit is probably taking pics of inanimate objects and landscapes. I didn't get to test this. 

Ok, now for credit where credit is due:

The selfie cam on the S21 had much better detail and contrast on my face. It took a solid selfie and I was surprised that it didn't smooth out my tired looking mug very much. The 3a XL does not take great selfies. 

I didn't get the photo from mom to show this, but the S 21 Ultra also took a much better night mode photo of my dark basement. It had better colors, less artificial sharpening, and more detail, and was quicker to take the photo. The large sensor wins here big time.

I didn't compare any zoom shots, where the S21 would make a great shot. And I didn't do any video, which is probably a strong point of the S21U as well. 

I just can't help but think... I've looked at 500 pictures of landscapes in which the new Samsungs look competitive. Do these tech reviewers ever take pictures of their family, friends, or pets?? For the money, I think my old 3a XL embarrassed the S21 Ultra. I was very surprised.",Android
Why do you prefer Android over iOS?,"Seen a couple of threads about this but they were pretty outdated and both OS's have undergone changes by then. Why you prefer Android over iOS?

Here are mine:

* Customisation: I can set default apps for web browsing, mail, my dialer app and launcher. This means I can choose an app that I like for my phone, unlike iOS where you have to use Apple's apps. I'm not saying these are bad, it's just that there aren't many options. Although you can set you default mail, browsing and music apps, Android lets you change virtually anything (there even apps that let you change your notifications shade to something like Samsung's or Xiaomi's!)
* Custom ROMs: Since Android is an open source OS, developers can use it's code and tweak it to make their own version of it, called a custom ROM. These are always updated with the latest version of Android, no matter what phone you have (as long as the developer wants to). Developers are also usually quick to fix bugs. This can make your phone last longer because it receives more updates and security patches.
* Notifications: Android handles notifications way better. Status bar icons let you know when you have a notification if you miss the sound. Notifications are sorted into conversations, notifications and silent (Android 11), making notifications easier to find.
* System wide adblockers",Android

Overview of major OS update support of Apple vs Google vs Samsung,"[https://i.imgur.com/tjGydmu.png](https://i.imgur.com/tjGydmu.png)

I thought I'd try and put some numbers against how much better Apple does in software support against Google and Samsung. 

I was surprised to find out that S9 didn't even get Android 11. And Samsung is only now promising 3 3 major updates for it's flagships something Apple has been doing since 2007!

Google is a little better but Pixel is EOL, Pixel 2 will likely not get Android 12 and 12 will probably be the last for Pixel 3.

Apples software support is on average around 6 years now, 50% longer than Google and twice as long as Samsung

OnePlus and lack of kernel sources (update),"Hey, guys. Following these [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/l2bgl7) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/l2estp) I made recently due to OnePlus not submitting the kernel sources for a few devices, I contacted the FreeSoftwareFoundation to investigate the possible violation and move forward. 

One of the issues I had contacting OnePlus is that support simply is not capable of helping with sources. Most of the tickets I opened would result in specialists that didn't understand what a GPLv2 violation is, couldn't to escalate the issue to the concerned team, or simply ignored me for a few days until I opened a complaint ticket asking for answers. A fair number of them would just link me to the forums, saying I should submit a post on their feedback section (lol). That's understandable, I guess, but it was a frustrating experience trying to contact someone that could fix this amicably. 

In any case, you can see here the FSF follow-up [https://i.imgur.com/sXIc0Ls.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/sXIc0Ls.jpg). Apparently, OnePlus needs to submit an offer to the source code, or the code itself, in the phone's manual and/or in the ""about phone"" section. I had some trouble finding anything that would get me said offer. I checked my phone box and the user manuals in the webpage, and didn't find anything either. I assume, and I may be wrong here, that OnePlus is not aware of that and didn't include said offer. However, if you guys could check it out, I would love to see your findings. I've also contacted support and explained that, attaching the email from the FSF guy, and they said that I would get a follow-up in an hour. It's been three hours since.

Also there are a LOT of sources lacking, and I hope OnePlus can sort this out as soon as possible. 
Thanks for reading this, and I'll update you guys once I get something from this.

This is relevant to other OEMs as well. If your manufacturer is not submitting the proper sources as intended, be free to contact compliance@sfconservancy.org. Be sure to explain thoroughly the packages violated and be as detailed as possible. As someone explained to me, you may be able to find the contact for sources in ""about phone &gt; legal information &gt; third party licenses"".

I just sent an email to oss.request@oneplus.com, as indicated in the ""third party licenses"" section, and will wait to see how they respond. Appreciate you guys.

How much does the availability of certain brands influence your choice?,"I see a lot of comments saying that Samsung is only popular in this sub because it's the default option in the US, and you can't find a lot of brands there. I live in Asia, and while we don't have Sony, LG or Google phones here, we have more options than an average American. Hell, I had to order my old Sony and LG from abroad, so that's possible as well. Yet I'm using a Samsung anyway, even though I'm not a big fan of their hardware, so not being able to buy a Vivo or Xiaomi phone wouldn't change anything for me (especially since I've already used a Xiaomi flagship and wouldn't want to come back). I'd consider the Pixel though.

**The Problem:** When a constantly-connected Bluetooth/BLE device, notably smartwatches (I've also had this problem in the past with Tile) has been set up on the phone; Bluetooth audio quality suffers immensely. Notable characteristics are that highs sound extremely compressed, often described as a ""hissing"" or ""static"" sound by those experiencing it. For audio nerds, it sounds like a sub-128kbps MP3 file, with lots of artifacts and noticeable data loss.

**The Devices:** I have personally experienced this issue in two scenarios now:

 Samsung Galaxy S10 5G (Verizon), using a Fitbit, as well as the same problem when I was using a Tile locator. I used both the Fitbit and Tile with my Pixel 2 XL and never had the issue until I switched to my S10 5G.

Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra (Verizon), while using my Samsung Galaxy Watch 3.

The problem seems isolated to certain phone models or manufacturers. Nexus/Pixel users historically don't seem to have any issues. Most reports seem to come from users of LG and Samsung phones. As mentioned, my problems I had a few years ago with my Fitbit and Tile didn't crop up until I switched from my Pixel to my Galaxy S10.

**The Details:** In my personal experience, the audio quality is affected on any device using AAC or SBC. I have noticed this in my cars, as well as my non-AptX or LDAC headphones. On these devices, you typically cannot change Bluetooth codecs. I have tried every option imaginable in developer options to no avail. Others seem to report the same.

The only way I have ever been able to remedy the problem is by completely disabling the smartwatch, ""disconnecting"" it in the phone companion app, and then restarting the phone with the watch turned off. Simply disconnecting or turning off the watch does not fix the problem, as the phone is still ""searching"" for the watch in the background even if it is disconnected, and even if you have force stopped the app. When I was using my Fitbit, the only way I could eliminate the issue entirely was by **uninstalling the Fitbit app from my phone.** 

It seems as though on certain platforms, particularly Samsung, a large chunk of Bluetooth bandwidth is being dedicated to the watch; and not enough is dedicated to the audio stream, and that dedication is permanent until the phone is restarted. Cycling Bluetooth on/off does not fix it.

**The Reality:** This is, for me, a deal-breaking issue. It was with my Fitbit on my S10, and it is now with my Watch 3 on my S21 Ultra. I listen to a LOT of music, especially in the car. Very few cars support any codec other than SBC; so you're really up a creek without a paddle if this is something that affects you. I've tried using Tasker to automate disabling/disconnecting the watch when connecting to my audio device, but as mentioned before, the only way you can remedy the problem is by completely turning the watch off, disconnecting it, and then restarting the phone. This isn't really a reasonable workaround for every time you get in the car.

This issue has been posted in a lot of places, and it seems to be a problem that has been around for 7-8+ years that has been completely unaddressed by Samsung, Google, or any relevant parties. When I selected my Watch 3 to go with my S21 Ultra, I had made the assumption that enough time had passed that the issue **had** to be resolved; especially with Bluetooth 5.0 and the improvements that have been made on the front of BT connectivity.

But here we are; years later, with no solution. Samsung has gone the route of eliminating the 3.5mm jack, so now if you're in the same boat as me, you're forced to choose between having Bluetooth audio that doesn't sound like AM radio, or having a smartwatch. You apparently aren't allowed to have both.

At this point I will likely be sending my Watch 3 back to Samsung, referencing what I've typed here today as my reasoning. I encourage anyone else with this issue to comment and add your input and experience as well. It may fall on deaf ears, but let the record show that Android users have been experiencing this same exact problem for almost a decade, and as manufacturers continue eliminating our choices and cornering us into Bluetooth, they fail to address the issues they present in doing so.",Android

"A lesser known way to boot into recovery using 'local' command shells, no root.","There's this app called Button Mapper (pro) . It can help customize buttons to do certain tasks, like you could set the volume button to screenshot etc.

Google Pixel 5 long-term review,,Android
Tried a budget android phone after years of flagships,"Recently, I purchased an Alcatel 1B for my son. I spent $100 CAD on it. I am currently using a Samsung Galaxy S10+, which was around $2000 CAD when I purchased it.

I am incredibly impressed at how well the budget Android phones work. The Samsung  is definitely better, but it is not 20x better. 

I Have always used the latest and greatest, thinking that I needed all the features, and the Alcatel has none of the new features (no wireless charging, not usb-c, no curved screen, only 2.4Ghz wifi, etc).

But wow, I have to say, I don't mind it being slightly slower, it is barely noticeable. Having a removeable battery is great, if we ever need to swap it out. The battery lasts almost all day as well, we only need to charge it at night.

I am quite impressed, it really reminds me of a flagship phone from a few years back, or the old Nexus devices, and really makes me question if the latest and greatest galaxy phone ($2500 CAD after tax) is worth 25 of the Alcatel 1Bs. 

I mean, for a comparable price,  I could replace the alcatel every single month for 2 years, and still pay less than a new Galaxy. Yeah it isn't waterproof, but I can just buy a new one if it get wet.

for reference, these phones aren't used for gaming, but if that is a concern, buy an alcatel every 3 months, and get a switch, still cheaper than a flagship.

&amp;#x200B;

I did not expect it to be that fast, or for the battery to last as long, and I am really impressed, and makes me question whether to spend all that money on a new flagship when my contract comes up for renewal.",Android

Comparing the OG G1 to the Pixel 4a 5G. What a long way we have come since 2008.,"I've been looking for days and the only benchmark score I could find for a G1 was a Geekbench 3 score of 45.  Single core only obviously. If we just compare single cores the 4a 5G nets 2825. A nearly 63x improvement. And that's not even counting the other 7 cores at the Pixel 4a 5G's disposal. If we do that it's 150x. 192mb of ram vs 6gb? A 32x increase. 

And to think how amazing the G1 seemed at the time even giving the iphone a run for it's money in several ways. I've used android phones since the G1 and have owned several nexus and pixel phones. And every upgrade seemed fairly incremental. But then again 12 years is a long time. The first device that really blew me away with it's performance was the Nexus 7 2013. It was really snappy compared to a lot of android devices at the time. It felt so smooth and buttery. And it was damn cheap too. I still use it today as a retroarch platform. And it works really well at that. It's not bad as a video player either. Bluetooth speakers are essential though.",Android

FYI: The S21 Ultra and S21 have a very different camera system this year.,"Unlike last year, this year the S21 Ultra has a clear advantage outside zoom. This is an important distinction that only a few reviewers like Andrew Martonik (DigitalTrends) point out:

&gt;Zoom capabilities aside, the S21 Ultra’s camera is so clearly a level above the base S21. The clarity, sharpness, and colors are all next-level.  Then you add in capable zoom, where the S21 is lacking … it’s not a competition.The S21 still struggles indoors. The Ultra is much much better.

Android Prefixer app alternative,"I found some posts of people trying to find alternatives for Prefixer.  Unfortunately after Prefixer was taken down there doesn't seem to be such an app on the Google Play Store, but shortly before Prefixer was removed there was another app that also had a similar functionality called IntlPrefix.  Prefixer still has a website, so I've contacted the creator of Prefixer.  I never received a reply so it seems unlikely both of these apps will receive further development.  Because they redirect calls from the default dialer app it's possible that this was the reason for them to be removed from the store.  Fortunately a copy of their .apk files can be found on APKPure and installed.  Additionally, IntlPrefix was released as an open source app and the source code with a compiled .apk are available on its github page https://github.com/gdassieu/intlprefix (app/app-release.apk).  After using both, Prefixer seems to have more functionality, but IntlPrefix might be safer to use requiring only two app permissions and providing the source code.  It runs without problems on Android 9 and uses slightly less resources.",Android

Play store reviews should require the hardware and version of android used by default,"When I'm checking reviews on play store, especially on some of the higher end games, there will be a lot of reviews stating how aspects of the software don't function but they won't include the hardware they are using to run the app. It's a degree of ignorance we should eliminate by either making it default to include what phone or tablet or whatever they are or requiring the poster enter it themselves to validate the review, if that makes sense. It's only natural that certain apps created in the last year aren't going to run on a Galaxy S7 so why should that contribute to negative scores in the marketplace? It would help me determine what reviews would be valid to my experience.",Android

Weight of the phone is the first thing I look now,"Switched to a G8 Power from the Mi A3 few months ago, overall I like the phone but not as much as I loved the Mi A3 for some particular reasons. One is the insanely agressive thermal throttling (the SD665 basically runs at \~65% speed all the time); the other is weight.

I didn't know it mattered that much. I have big hands, I can use the G8 Power with one hand even with it being big (6.4"" 19:9), thick (9.7mm) and heavy (234g with case and screen protector), but on long usage sessions, my pinky gets absolutely destroyed. I did not have these kind of issues with the much lighter and compact Mi A3.

From now on, I will actively look for phones that do not weigh above 175g. That's the sweet spot with a case + screen protector. A phone like the Pixel 4a would be absolutely amazing for me even if it was a little overpriced, but Google's world map only has like 6 countries or something smh",Android

Some Samsung apps seem to be no longer showing ads (in some phones?),"I have the Galaxy Fold 2 and the S21, both are the US unlocked models bought off of the Samsung store. I've noticed that on Fold 2, there seem to be no ads in certain apps such as Weather, and Samsung Health, but I do see the ads on my S21 (regular version). I don't know if this is a random test Samsung is doing or if they made an exception for their $2k Fold 2 phone. I honestly think few ads in certain apps are ""okay"" if aren't excessive and in your face. Even iPhone [shows ads](https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1352795378119151621/photo/1) after all.

Other things I've noticed:

* Also, Samsung Pay ads seem less intrusive now. It's now its own module rather than a top banner, and the ads seem to be mostly special deals associated with Samsung which sort of make sense for a financial app.
* Samsung Music also doesn't seem to have an ad as the very first track. So maybe Samsung is paying attention to our concerns.
* Also on the S21, the new phone dialer app no longer has the ""Places"" tab which to me felt like an ad even though it wasn't an ad so I'm quite happy about that.

Considering Samsung historically listened to us regarding update support, TouchWiz UI, Bixby button, Google now feed, and many other complaints, I do think Samsung will do something about the ads situation in the future.

How does Google benefit from Android?,"Yes, I know that it gives them a place to put GApps and profit, but hear me out.

Google gets to lead the way in mobile advertising because of the Google Play Store, and there is a lot of revenue in advertising and having Chrome and Search bundled with Android, but then Google has always sold Google Apps under a license to OEMs. That explains the reason to keep building it.

But for so many years now, Google has introduced so many initiatives to unify Android, and deal with updates and fragmentation. Treble, Mainline, and the Generic Kernel Image initiative - all of them ensure that Android is more uniform, and that its easier for Google to ensure updates. Here, people might say that these updates are incredible from a security and bug-fixing perspective, and I agree. But I don't understand why a company, even Google, would make so many efforts without any commercial incentive. I also know that people might say that developers might find it easier to build apps, but isn't the Compatibility Definition Document there for this exact reason?  


Edit - Yes, I know they gain data from us. But that means they'll promote Android adoption, not make it a more secure platform. Security isn't really the most important thing to a lot of people, you know? Thanks for all the advice though, helped a lot.",Android

Which apps that benefit from ADB do you value the most?,"I bet quite a few of us have managed to enable [ADB](https://www.xda-developers.com/what-is-adb/) on our smartphones. With tons of help from xda &amp; reddit, I managed to do it a few days ago.


So lets share apps that benefit (or require) adb the most (and if at all possible, please include a link :)

I'll start with:
[SystemUI Tuner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zacharee1.systemuituner&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US)
&gt; For some reason, a lot of manufacturers seem to have a problem with us customizing our own devices, to the point where some disable the built-in Android System UI Tuner.
&gt; 
&gt; This app aims to fix that problem, by providing a replacement. For the most part, this is a replica of Android's System UI Tuner; however, there are a few extra goodies that Android's solution doesn't include by default.
&gt; 
&gt; Using this app you can:
&gt; - Control which icons appear in your status bar (not every toggle will work on every device).
&gt; - Customize Demo Mode.
&gt; - Control the importance level of notifications (7.0+; doesn't work well on Samsung).
&gt; - Enable some hidden features of Android.
&gt; - Toggle Immersive Mode.
&gt; - Change Quick Settings options (TouchWiz 7.0 users can change the grid size).
&gt; - Customize animation speeds.

Resetting your phone completely and choosing a new launcher is great!,"Did this over the weekend and it feels like I've got a brand-new and different phone.

One of the best things about Android is how much you can personalise it is, yet somehow I end up using the same home screen setup for a year without changing a thing.

I had loads of unused apps and random stuff on my phone, so decided a deep clean would be a good shout, and didn't use any phone backup to restore previous apps. Phone certainly feels snappier and it has been nice to select a new launcher and go for a different home screen setup! 

Can recommend in these times where we seem to have more time on our hands...

Thoughts on Galaxy S21 Ultra,"After doing the math on Samsung's preorder deals for the S21 lineup, I decided that getting an S21 Ultra was too good of a deal to pass up (with a bit of work, I got the 256gb model for $500 before taxes, *without trading in my current phone*).

I've had the phone for a few days now, and wanted to give my thoughts on how it compares to my current Pixel 4XL. For context, I owned a Galaxy S10 prior to my Pixel.

Things the S21 Ultra does well:

* Battery life: the battery life on this phone is genuinely amazing. I usually only charge my phone to 80%, and even then I'm couldn't kill it in a day. 5000mah with the newer, more efficient OLED screen really works. 
* General hardware quality: other than a couple things, Samsung has significantly better hardware than my old Pixel. The screen is an upgrade in basically every aspect (120hz is definitely smoother than 90hz, and it doesn't suffer from any color shift at low brightness like my Pixel). The speakers are better, the overall tolerances are tighter. I still prefer Google's software experience, but man Samsung can really make a nice phone. 
* Big phone features: Samsung has really useful big-phone features, especially compared to stock android. One hand operation plus is great, and there's just been generally more thought put into how split screen and multi-window should work. I also really missed edge panel when I originally switched to the Pixel, and enjoy having it back now. 

Things the S21 Ultra doesn't do so well:

* Feel in hand: there's no way around how heavy and unwieldy the Ultra is. It's not much larger physically than my Pixel, but it's much heavier, with an enormous camera bump. These combine to make this a significantly less comfortable phone to use, with the camera bump (1) making the phone feel much more top heavy, and (2) constantly bumping into my finger when I'm holding the phone. 
* The little things: I got this sense when I owned the S10, but I always felt like Samsung priotizes huge, flashy features when designing their phones, and often forgets or ignores the little things. This feeling is definitely still here with the S21 Ultra. From the past couple days:
  * The proximity sensor is broken. Samsung's proximity sensor implementation is essentially: ""is there any skin touching the top portion of the phone?"" Covering the top of the phone with a non-conductive material (e.g. clothing) does *not* trigger the proximity sensor, which results in the AOD not turning off when the phone is pocketed, and has caused multiple accidental pocket unlocks if I don't turn off double tap/lift to wake. 
  * Samsung is missing a lot of small but useful software features that I constantly use on my Pixel, such as flip for DND, phone screening/hold for me, auto night mode in the camera, etc.
  * Samsung for some reason continues to insist on including duplicate system apps, many of which are objectively worse than the Google alternatives. I wish Samsung would focus more on things like Dex (genuinely useful and an actual differentiator!), rather than wasting time and storage space on things like the Galaxy Store, Bixby, and calendar/calculator clones.
  * Haptics: Samsung's haptic feedback is significantly more mushy/less precise than the Pixel's. This is especially clear when typing in Gboard with haptics enabled, where each keypress on the Pixel feels like a very well defined click, whereas on the S21 it feels more like a farty buzz. Also, Samsung has less haptic feedback scattered across the OS, which makes the holistic usage experience much less tactile and immersive. 
  * Personal preference, but why are icons on the home screen cartoonishly large, with no option to change the sizing? I'm not blind Samsung...

Things that are a wash between the two:

* Cameras: the Galaxy has a much more versatile camera system, just due to the sheer number of lenses, but I still prefer the Pixel's overall look. This is personal preference as well, but I like the Pixel's more contrasty, natural look over Samsung's slight oversaturation and aversion to shadows. Also, while it has improved significantly from the S10, the S21 Ultra still has some slight shutter lag when taking photos.
* Biometric authentication: in a pandemic, the fingerprint sensor is more convenient, but I prefer face unlock more overall. Also personal preference however. The larger ultrasonic fingerprint sensor has basically fixed all my complaints with the gen 1 version on the S10 though.

Overall, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a really, really good Samsung phone. It does well at all the things that Samsung phones do well, but has the same shortcomings that Samsung has always had as well. I still prefer the overall experience of the Pixel more (it just works™), but I'm still very tempted to fully switch over to the S21 Ultra just for the amazing display and battery life. I'll give it a few more weeks before making a final decision, but this is going to be a really tough choice. 

Anyways, I have the phone on hand, so feel free to AMA.

Anyone considering jumping ship to Apple lately?,"I've been rocking a Galaxy phone since the S3. Typically a really big fan of the phones -- I still think Samsung makes some of the best flagship phones in the Android market.

That being said, I'm disappointed in where the market is headed, an iPhone gets more appealing by the day.

**Grievances**

* My Samsung Active2 is total trash compared to my girlfriends Apple Watch. The GPS and heart rate monitor are hilariously inaccurate (+/- 0.3 miles, every time). The UI is messy and just not intuitive to use. Completely worthless as a fitness watch and a lame side extension of your phone.
* Still no real iMessage competitor! Google Messages is clunky/slow and Link-to-Windows stopped working a few months back and the only solution I've found online is to factory reset my phone. Uh, no.
* PRIVACY! This is a big one. The recent iOS 14 updates seem like Apple is [giving the middle finger](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/facebook-blasts-apple-in-new-ads-over-iphone-privacy-change-.html) to Facebook and other apps that track what you're doing excessively. Meanwhile my S9+ is preloaded with FB and I can't uninstall it. I've never felt comfortable enabling Bixby either, seems like another data collection service/revenue stream for Samsung

Anyone else thinking along the same lines? Really frustrated in the direction Android has headed in the past 5-ish years. Give me a half decent watch, iMessage, and freedom from Zucc and I'd be happy. I still hate how iOS is laid out vs. Android.

**EDIT:** Thanks everyone, lot to think about here. If Apple had already switched over to USB-C I think this decision would be a lot easier. Think I'm going to pick up a 12-Mini once they go on sale.",Android
Where to get reviews of Android devices outside of the social media/affiliate link ecosystem?,"I've come to the conclusion that the existence of affiliate links has made it almost impossible to get discerning critical coverage of products. Even the negative reviews are basically advertisements, that just throw me in a few cautious warnings about missing features. And the popular ones seems to be just surface-level stuff for the most part. 

This applies to YouTube of course, but also a lot of the popular websites too whose coverage is almost entirely focused on providing links and making it easy for you to buy stuff.



To be fair reviews in either places like the New York times and Washington Post aren't much better. They do have much stronger ethics rules, and the individual reviewers aren't directly benefiting from sales, but they tend to be list of the five most popular devices in any particular market. And it also tends to parrot conventional wisdom.

I would be more than willing to pay for reviewers who remove themselves entirely from out of ecosystem and do critical reviews as a matter of policy. There are outliers on YouTube...tech tablets,  for instance.

but even the most diligent well-meaning YouTubers still tend to be pretty positive in their reviews of almost every device. 

Tl;dr... Is there anywhere to find critical reviews of products besides message boards and forums?;are there any alternatives to YouTube and social media for reviews of Android devices?",Android

"Synaptics Expands Family of AI-enriched, High-Performance Multimedia SoCs for Mainstream Set-Top Boxes, Smart Video Devices",,Android
Returning the Galaxy S21 Ultra,"To start: I've been highly anticipating this phone.  I've had two Google Pixel 3 XLs that my SO and I have been using since release day.  Probably one of the best overall phones I've owned, first phone to make it past the two year mark before attempting replacement.  I've had cell phones since 1996 mind you (I was in high school at the time and lucky enough to have a job in web development / system administration and I was on-call for the company I was employed by, but I digress).  Anyway...

I've worked in enterprise security (consultant, FTE and on the vendor side) for the bulk of my professional career post-college.  I've been, generally, OK with both Android and IOS over the years - give or take different areas of concern/complaint.  I own a number of iPads and iPhones currently, but my daily driver is the P3XL.

I didn't realize Samsung was as bad as they currently are for hidden apps and outlandish permissions in their own ecosystem of software.

The first problem I noticed was that Facebook is installed by default.  Red flag.  I uninstalled and immediately went to look through the system apps to validate there were no other Facebook components lying around.  *And there are*.  There are **three** Facebook components you cannot uninstall but can only disable: *Facebook App Installer*, *Facebook App Manager* and *Facebook Services*.  If you're keeping your Galaxy S21 and don't use Facebook I'd recommend disabling them and validating background data is disabled as they may be reenabled on system updates (I'm not sure if that's true or not).  The reality is they very well could be and you wouldn't know it - given the circumstances I'd err on the side of trust - *but definitely verify*.

The second problem I ran into was Microsoft OneDrive.  Again, not able to uninstall it - you can disable it.  Obviously these apps are all part of the system image and is the reason you can't actually remove them.  FFS.

The third, and final nail, is Bixby Voice.  This app cannot be uninstalled, cannot be disabled and all permissions are immutable (meaning they cannot be changed).  I understand Samsung is, and has been, trying to force Bixby on it's users for years.  I thought Samsung had moved on and relinquished control.  I was, unfortunately, wrong.  Final nail in the coffin for me.

So... Does Google do this on Pixel devices?  Sure, to an extent with Google components.  Does Apple do this on IOS?  Yes.  The difference is that the Google apps on a Pixel device aren't harboring controls that can't be overridden.  I can turn off permissions on the ""Google"" app, say - the microphone permission, even though it may break functionality.  I can live with that.  But I'm not OK with giving control up to something like Bixby Voice that has, literally, every permission 24/7.

I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the complacency involved with being OK with this and that's the rationale for returning the device.  So, Samsung, if you're reading this (who am I kidding, you're not)  - what an amazing phone with regard to the hardware.  Truly top notch, truly polished and pushes all of the right buttons.  You didn't lose a customer because the phone wasn't designed well.  You lost a customer because it's clear that on top of the $1200+ phone you have the audacity to treat your customers as if they don't care - that they're not concerned with privacy in the least, and you clearly don't want them to be given what you've delivered.  The reality is Google isn't a bastion of hope in that department either.  Nor is Apple.  But the Pixel line and IOS devices give end users a level of control if they're willing to give up features or functionality.  I'd be fine with Bixby being on the phone if I could disable it and know that it's not able to phone home.  But that's not possible sans drastic measures.  Measures that would lock me out of functionality I do use.

So Samsung.  No, you don't get my money and a complacent response to your privacy ignorant stance.  I won't waste my time with the Samsung brand moving forward.  I hope others voice their concern and skip Samsung until these things are handled correctly.  I know I'm a minority at this point in time, but the tides are slowly changing.",Android

When I'm holding it landscape, I have to contort my hand to reeeach the edge of the screen to swipe to go back.

Imo battery life differences are superficial in flagships,"It's definitely great to have improved battery life, don't get me wrong. But it seems really silly to me how crazy people go over a phone that has 45 more minutes SOT compared to a different brands flagship.

Then we come to the question of usage. Say your phone has a SOT of 7 hours. Are you really going to use that entire battery before you get to an outlet or car? I'm really curious what people do with their phones for this to matter so much.

Alternatively, what if you lack the ability to charge your phone in the day of use for the full hour and 20 minutes it needs? Wouldn't the ability to charge your phone faster be an equal if not better option?

Idk. I just don't see why battery life is such a debated thing when outlets are everywhere and we have flagships that can charge their 4000mah batteries fully in 15 minutes

Dual cell batteries are on of the biggest breakthroughs in years but get no buzz

OnePlus has not released the kernel sources for their devices (again),"Yup. I'm doing this one more time. I'm afraid to inform you guys that OnePlus hasn't released their kernel sources for the Android 11 Open Beta for the Nord and 7 Series. I [made](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/btc78x/oneplus_hasnt_updated_their_kernel_sources_in_a/) a [couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/btc6ly) of posts a year ago, and I intend to do the same again (YAY). Not releasing their sources is a clear violation of the GPLv2. 

That time, the 7 Series were the only devices up-to-date, while the others were lagging behind for a month, roughly. Ironic that now, having a 7 Pro in my hands, I'm again opening the discussion in this sub to get this some traction. It may not seem like a big deal, but the sources need to be up from the time their build hits the public. That helps, for instance, developers building custom kernels for the new firmware. [It's not just about that, though](https://www.androidauthority.com/gpl-violations-bad-834569/). 

The archived threads I linked above will also have a lot of useful info in the comments from people that are MUCH better at explaining this - and the repercussions - than I am. So, sorry about that ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ. 

You guys can check their [GitHub](https://github.com/OnePlusOSS) yourselves just to make sure.

Thanks for your attention!

Edit: They haven't released their sources for OxygenOS 10.3.6 nor 10.3.7 as well for the 7 series, so that's fun...",Android
"Why third party apps on Android have bad camera quality, and when things will improve.","As an Android developer, I wanted to provide some insight as to why Android third-party camera quality is often worse than on iOS, and why they don't look as good as the phone's stock camera app.

First, we have to understand there are 3 different camera APIs provided by Google available for Android developers:

* Camera - The original and now the oldest camera API. It's supported on most amount of Android devices but it has very limited features.
* Camera2 - Updated version of the original Camera API available on devices Android 5+. This is what most modern apps will try to use. It has more functionalities than Camera but it doesn't support advanced features like using the vendor's HDR algorithm.
* CameraX - This is Google's new API available on devices Android 5+. It's built on top of Camera2 and is meant to make life significantly easier for developers such as by letting Google take care of the hard work of optimizing and testing on various devices. This API supports extension algorithms such as HDR, night mode, and portrait mode assuming the device vendor has added support for it (e.g. newer galaxies since S10 support it). However, this API is still in development and still doesn't have a full stable release yet.

The problem with Android right now is, all the APIs have some sort of drawback. Camera API is only good for very simple use cases. Camera2 API is a headache to implement and optimize, has no HDR, and only runs on newer Androids so you have to build fallbacks for older Androids. CameraX is promising but it still doesn't have a stable release yet, meaning popular apps like Snapchat/TikTok/Instagram are very hesitant to use it. iOS's camera API is much simpler to use in comparison and already has HDR processing baked into it.

Since smartphone camera quality highly depends on HDR processing nowadays, it has become a necessity for Android third-party apps to use the newer CameraX. The question is: *When will the long overdue CameraX be ready for larger apps to use?* I predict that we'll have a stable release of CameraX sometime in H2 of this year, and you should see various apps adding proper support for it towards the end of the year.

TLDR: Current Android camera APIs aren't really great for developers, and do not support the vendor's HDR algorithms. The new CameraX API is very promising and should fix all the issues, but it's still in development and it will take a while before it gains mass adoption by Android developers.",Android

Android 11's App Suggestions feature quietly nudges users towards using Google's own services,"**App Suggestions** is a feature in Android 11, as described on [the Android website](https://www.android.com/android-11/):

&gt;Pixel devices now make app suggestions based on your daily routines. These apps show up on the bottom row of your home screen. So you can get the apps you need when you need them.

However, I've recently discovered that in Google's view, ""the apps you need"" just happen to be the ones that make them money.

Despite having never once used the YouTube Music app that's preinstalled on and uninstallable from my Pixel 4 XL, I noticed that whenever I plug my USB-C headphones or USB-C DAC into the phone, Android *always* suggests YouTube Music as an App Suggestion.

* I've tried listening to music for an hour with headphones, 30 minutes each of the two apps I actually use regularly for music, then immediately unplugging the headphones and plugging them back in. Android always removes one of the two apps I'd just been using from suggestions and replaces it with YouTube Music.
* I've tried pinning 4 non-music apps in the 5 App suggestion spaces so there's only a single spot for a suggestion. Even after listening to music on my most-used music app and having that app as the current occupant of the lone App suggestion slot, plugging in headphones replaces that suggestion with the (never-used) YouTube music.

&amp;#x200B;

Just so it's clear, I understand how to go to the Home settings and block specific apps from being suggested (and I've done that now for YouTube Music). *This is not a tech support post.*

It just seems improper that Google is secretly promoting their own apps in what should be (and is described as) a neutral, user-driven feature, and when I searched for it I didn't see any other discussion of this, so I wonder how many know it's going on.

This is also part of a larger discussion about Google using its position as the developer of Android to drive consumers to their other products--the most notable example I could think of before now is the way the helpful Google Now feed was removed from its privileged spot in the left-most home screen page with a News feed as part of Google's battle with Facebook to control the largest share of digital advertising space. I'm sure some people here have other good examples, and I would be interested in hearing them, too.",Android

Exclusive first look at the Sony XPERIA 10 III - Steve Hemmerstoffer - Voice,,Android
A possible solution to android issues,"I have been long term android user but have been thinking of switching because of issues like heavy bloatware, System wide ads, lack of long-term software support, etc etc. A big reason could be that the android phone market is competitive and the margins are razor thin; so OEMs have to rely on other methods to cut costs &amp; generate revenue. In comparison, Apple has a significant chunk coming from app store purchases and services. Though android OEMs including samsung, xiaomi, etc have their own store, it hasn't been very successful. I was wondering why don't OEMs collaborate and have a competitive play store alternative. This would be beneficial to companies like Spotify, Epic as well as small developers. A revenue model that splits between store BAU costs and OEM share could be figured out.

&amp;#x200B;

I can foresee a number of advantages to this:

1. Less bloatware and ads in System settings and apps - The OEMs won't have to resort to system ads and bloat to increase profitability. 

2. Longer Software support - The eventually want people to use their device, and not switch to competitor. 

3. More competition - We might have legit competition to play store, and companies like Huawei won't be so handicapped because of removal of play store.

4. Higher share to developers - Since significantly less share goes to apple and google (30% currently)

5. Miscellaneous - Since OEMs would like to keep us using their device, they might have better support or maybe even removable batteries.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I missing something important? And why aren't OEMs spending resources on this?

Article on how to use Microsoft Edge Read Aloud TTS engine on Android instead of default Google TTS engine.,"**Steps:**

**1. What is Microsoft Edge Read Aloud?**

See [here](https://i.imgur.com/r23GnvH.png)

These voices are also available on Microsoft Edge Android Browser.

The voices are natural-sounding and soothing to hear.

We extract the TTS engine from the browser and install it on our device.

**2. Where to find TTS engine for Microsoft Edge Read Aloud?**

The download site is in Chinese language.

Link to download APK is [here](https://lanzoui.com/iKXJVkm2x2j) or on Google Drive [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e0fk3tPlrPsCDpzb_hWPpjCemj7h-I0q/view?usp=sharing)

After downloading and installing, select this option shown in the image [here](https://i.imgur.com/bMDOYd6.jpg)

This will open the Preferred engine settings, select the engine shown in the image [here](https://i.imgur.com/BEtUgwq.jpg)

**3. Done try it out!**

Open for example any app where you use TTS. Here I opened Moon Reader Pro and opened a PDF and instructed the app to read aloud by clicking on speaker icon as shown [here](https://i.imgur.com/9sTbvDJ.jpg)

The voice is from Microsoft Edge Read Aloud TTS engine and NOT from default Google TTS engine!

PS: It's important to note that use it if you trust or don't use it otherwise.

I am using it for accessibility reasons and how good the voices are.  


**UPDATE:** It's broken as of 7th March 2021. Even the official Android Microsoft Edge Browser stopped using that TTS engine.

Earlier the edge browser for Android had these natural voices. Now the only desktop has.

I am not sure if the changes are temporary or not. The best we can do right now is notify [https://twitter.com/MSEdgeDev](https://twitter.com/MSEdgeDev) or file feature requests on MS forums to bring the natural voices back.",Android

Incognito Mode For Camera!,"Don't you think this would come in handy? Many of us use our phone cameras to take photos we only want to see and use in certain applications. We don't want them popping up in our main gallery. Wouldn't it be great if Google could add support for an ""incognito mode"" metadata tag to Google Photos and the stock gallery app. Images &amp; videos with that tag would be excluded from the main gallery by default. Then Google and the OEMs could add an Incognito Mode to their camera apps that simply adds this tag to all images &amp; videos you take. App devs like, say, Grindr/Tinder/Whatever devs could add support for browsing these images via the SDK. What do you all think? Should I submit this as a feature request to Google, and does anyone know the best way to do that?

**Update:** Turns out Samsung phones already do this. But I still maintain it should be baked into stock Android as well. It's a cool feature!",Android
Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G Disassembly Teardown Repair Video Review,,Android
S21 Haptics Downgraded,"I went to Best Buy to check out the S21 display units today and I tested the haptics against my Pixel 2 XL, a Pixel 5, a Note 20 Ultra, a Z Fold 2, and an iPhone 12 Pro Max. I think haptics matter a lot in the experience you get with a phone and it's something reviewers usually ignore completely. I found that the S21 (all three models) had weaker haptics than the Note 20 Ultra. It feels like a downgrade. It also feels, on the Ultra at least, like it's coming from a specific point at the back of the phone which does not feel good. 

Now the caveat must be made that they used the Samsung keyboard and Pixels use Gboard so some of it might be down to that but the vibration is much stronger on the Pixels (though not as tight) and moving the cursor on the Samsungs by dragging on the spacebar doesn't feel like each letter gets a satisfying click as the cursor passes over it. The iPhone is still a million light years ahead of everything else despite using it a lot less (not used on default keyboard). I couldn't feel any vibration on the Z Fold 2. I don't know if display models having the security things plugged in affects it but I wouldn't imagine that would make a huge difference.

This doesn't change my decision in pre-ordering an S21 Ultra, more testing is needed, and I'm not trying to add to the over-the-top complaining that's been going on with the S21 series, but I thought this would be valuable info for people and I'd like to hear others' takes on the haptics.

Edit: Several people have stated that the Samsung keyboard is in fact lighter on haptics than Gboard. There is also a setting to increase vibration intensity. So more testing is needed and don't take my quick findings as gospel.",Android

The Galaxy Bud Pros are uncomfortable,"I'll start off by saying that I have been looking forward to the Bud Pros for a LONG time. I use my Buds+ nearly all day from my walk to work, calls/music at work, and on my walk home. I live in NYC so active noise cancellation is a big deal. Here are my initial thoughts from using the Bud Pros for a day...

#**Pros**
The sound, even for someone who's not an audiophile like me but is also not a novice, is noticeably better. The deep bass and less metallic highs are what stick out to me.

#**Cons**
The active noise cancellation is just okay which is echoed in most of the reviews I've seen so far. At the gym, I could hear the whirl of my elliptical, dudes chucking weights, and light conversation even with the volume at 75%~.  If you've ever tried Airpod Pros, you'll know they BLOW away the Bud Pros without question. Disappointing.


Arguably the worst aspect of these that I haven't seen anyone else online mention is how comfortable they are - or lack thereof. After an hour of having them in, I could not wait to take them out. The Pros are significantly longer than the Buds+ but aren't ergonomically shaped to the ear canal. The Bud+ rest flat against the inner ear and the Pros have a massive bulge that not only prevents a seal but also makes it painful if you move your ear in the slightest such as talking, smiling, etc.

Comparison of shapes - Pros vs Buds+
https://imgur.com/a/8DvKlGS

I'm going to try these out for another day or two and if that uncomfortableness is still there, I'm going to reluctantly send them back. I could have the Bud+ in my ear for a whole 6+ hour plan trip with no problem. These, I have to take them out after an hour.

Has anyone else experienced the ear strain like me?


**UPDATE**: Ordered some [AKG N400](https://www.amazon.com/AKG-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earphones-Silver/dp/B088CZR6TY) to test. Crinacle gave these the same score as the Pros. They have less battery life and okay ANC but keep the Buds+ form factor.

**UPDATE 2**: The N400 are fantastic. They fit like the Buds+ and have sound of the pros. I don't think they look as stylish but I'm willing to trade that off.",Android

Qualcomm Snapdragon 870: 'New' CPU for affordable top smartphones,,Android
FHD v QHD Pentile Displays,"With the recent release of the Galaxy S21 series, a new debate of FHD v QHD has risen. Like many previous debates about the eye (24FPS vs 60+FPS, for example), a lot of generalities get thrown around that are mixed with people's personal experiences.

One of the leading items that's.lead to people concluding that FHD isn't noticeable on small phone screens seems to stem from Samsung's decision to push people to use FHD &amp; 120Hz on all their phones last year, despite the panels being QHD. I have no doubt that people couldn't tell a difference of sharpness. The problem is that people think this difference will likewise be imperceptible on the S21 &amp; S21+ of a FHD screen being run at FHD resolution.

A lot of this misperception is being driven by this Android Authority piece:

https://www.androidauthority.com/qhd-vs-fhd-1079649/

The problem is that their conclusion that they reached fails to take in account the *sub pixel layout.*

&gt;Then there’s the argument of pixel density. Any 6.5-inch display at Full HD is going to look impeccable. 330ppi at 10-inches from your face is the limit at which the human eye can spot individual pixels. Unless you hold your phone unreasonably close to your face, you don’t really need any more than 330ppi.

Had they been referring to a normal LCD with a RGB layout with a 1920x1080 screen, this would be true. In this arrangement, your have just over 2 million red, green &amp; blue sub pixels. For QHD this is about 3.7 million pixels, with equal red, green and blue pixels.

But pentile displays don't use this arrangement...


Pentile displays use 1 red &amp; blue sub pixel for every 2 pixels and 2 green sub-pixels for every 2 pixels. So a QHD display only has 3.7 million *green* pixels and just over 1.8 million *red* and *blue* sub-pixels. If you notice, this is less than a FHD sub-pixel count for these sub-pixels.


If we look at pixel density, the S20 is 421 ppi. The S21 is 394 ppi.

These seem perfectly acceptable. But the density of green pixels is 421 &amp; 394 respectively, whereas red &amp; blue sub pixel density is *210* &amp; *194* respectively. Again, for some people, this might not be noticeable. But is is definitely below the 300PPI proclaimed in the article.

If we look at last year's S20 plus, it had a 525ppi. This gave a ppi for blue &amp; green sub pixels of 262. That's about a 25% decrease in density.

Now, I can't tell you, as an individual, if you can notice this. But there haven't been any huge revolutions in the pixel packing since 2014, with the only minor improvement being with the iPhone X.

For detailed information of Pentile v RGB LCD:

The conclusion is that stuff like ""you won't notice a a difference"" should stop. There are pros and cons, and some people can tell the difference. 

But, I am disappointed in the technological step backwards.",Android

How Law Enforcement Gets Around Your Smartphone's Encryption,"This recently released [research paper: Data Security on Mobile Devices: Current State of the Art, Open Problems, and Proposed Solutions](https://securephones.io/main.html) by [Matthew Green and his team](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1341746171220537344.html) which is also covered by [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/smartphone-encryption-law-enforcement-tools/) talks about design flaw in data encryption of android and iOS. Wired brushes off most of the technical details and the paper didn't cover [android's File Based Encryption](https://source.android.com/security/encryption/file-based) very well which I think needs some clarity on it. The paper draws the correct conclusion though and what should be improved in successor android versions.

----------

In android 7+, `/data` partition is encrypted by **File Based Encryption** (FBE) on first boot by default. FBE keys are generated in **hardware-backed keystore**. FBE keys are encrypted in keystore with the key derived from user's screen lock password. So unless you enter correct password, keystore cannot decrypt FBE keys. When you reboot your device, it is in **Before First Unlock** (BFU) state which means the user has yet to unlock screen first time since reboot. In this state, if someone calls you or messages you, their name won't show up unless you unlock your screen. That's because the device is waiting for your lock screen password which is to be used to decrypt FBE keys and FBE keys are encrypting your contact names.

Once you unlock your screen first time since reboot, it goes to **After First Unlock** (AFU) state which means the user has unlocked the device first time since reboot. Further locking and unlocking won't revert the state unless you reboot again which throws you back on BFU.

----------

**Temporary per-boot key**: In AFU state, FBE keys are decrypted by the keystore and are immediately re-encrypted again by a temporary per-boot key. Per-boot key is generated &amp; stored by keystore and its validity is until next reboot. Encrypted FBE keys blob is then **cached** in `/system/vold`. This ensures that FBE keys are never in plain text when cached by the OS.

----------

As FBE keys are cached though encrypted, you can now use your biometric to unlock screen and kernel can request keystore to decrypt FBE keys on demand means whenever an application wants to read and write, kernel will load FBE keys in memory and they will remain in memory until next reboot. That's because running apps need them for read and write even if you lock your screen. E.g. To display contacts on lock screen, sharing live location, listening to music, sync services, etc. they need those keys in memory else they won't work on locked screen.

This opens a security hole. Users don't often reboot their devices for months so it is in AFU state. The intruder and law enforcement can extract those keys from memory to decrypt sensitive data of running applications without knowing your screen lock. **This procedure requires carefully exposing the SoC without disconnecting the battery.**

----------

iOS encrypts personal data with keys that are evicted from memory 10 seconds after locking the screen. When it is in BFU state, iPhone needs password to derive a **Class key**. At this time, biometric won't work. When it is in AFU state, it caches **Class key** in Secure Enclave. Now user can use biometric and cached Class key is used to re-derive those evicted keys again when screen is locked and unlocked.

----------

This keys eviction feature is what android also needs otherwise if the intruder is able to decrypt whole `/data` partition, he can own that data in it or if he wants to own the stolen device and doesn't care about the data, he could be able to set `enable` bit for OEM unlocking. Thent he can go to bootloader mode and unlock the bootloader.

&gt; In most cases, FBE keys also undergo an additional key derivation step in the kernel in order to generate the subkeys actually used to do the encryption, for example per-file or per-mode keys.

If FBE keys are compromised, so will sub-keys so this derivation step doesn't add much protection even if sub-keys are evicted in newer versions. Android should keep FBE key bundle in keystore itself and load sub-keys in memory some of which can be evicted after screen lock.

Law enforcement can just force your fingerprint to unlock your device and can lie about that in court that it was already unlocked at the time of arrest so no kind of device security can stop them. Locks deter only honest people.

----------

Most common questions:

1. Why biometric doesn't work after reboot?

- After reboot, the device is in BFU state and waiting for you to enter PIN/password which can be used to derive key that decrypts FBE keys.

2. How does biometric decrypt FBE keys again when the user locks and unlocks the screen second time (or Nth time)?

- It doesn't. FBE keys were already decrypted by the keystore when the screen was unlocked first time since reboot (They are re-encrypted by a different key and cached, see temporary per-boot key section). When you unlock using biometric, keystore lets the OS know that the user is verified and should be allowed access. This is enforced by SELinux policy.

3. I forgot my PIN/password, why do I need to factory reset the device to use my phone? That would erase all my data.

- Your PIN/password is used to derive key that encrypts and decrypts FBE keys as explained in the post. If you have forgotten your PIN/password, your data cannot be decrypted anyway so even if there was a feature to reset PIN without factory reset, it would be useless. Instead it would allow thieves to reset PIN and reuse your device.

4. If data partition is not decrypted until you enter your password, where does the phone store things like language, wallpaper, wifi logins, Bluetooth pairings that are visible right after the phone boots?

- I intentionally left out this part that FBE has 2 types of storage:

  Device Encrypted Storage: This is directly encrypted by keystore and do not require your password for decryption.

  Credentials Encrypted Storage: This is encrypted with a key derived from your password.

  The most basic functionalities are encrypted under device encrypted storage so that your phone will be still usable for taking calls and receiving messages even if you don't unlock it.

5. **While in lockdown mode, my contact names are still showing up on call**

- I checked in settings and it says that it **turns off smart lock, fingerprint and notifications on lock screen**. So it doesn't clear keys in memory probably because Google wants to ensure usability of background apps like listening to music. This means it may disable biometric for law enforcement but won't put your phone back in BFU state.

  Android apps process cycle isn't designed to adapt if FBE keys are suddenly cleared from memory without letting the apps know. It would instantly crash most of the system apps and services because of I/O error when they couldn't find keys. In iOS, apps are alerted that the user has locked the device.

6. Why can't biometric be used as a key to decrypt FBE keys?

- Because you always put your finger slightly differently on the sensor. Keystore approves authentication if enough of the mathematical values match. To use something as a key or to derive a key from something, you need something that doesn't change and always produces the same output.

7. What about multi-user phones? I have a dummy profile set up and if I never unlocked my main profile after reboot I can't see it's files from it.  But if I have unlocked previously I see them.

- If multi-user profiles are set up, keys can be recovered for currently running user only. When you switch user, keys for earlier user are cleared from memory. That's another good way to stay safe without rebooting the device.

8. Wait, why is only `/data` partiton encrypted, but system partitons are not?

- You don't need encryption for system partitions. Other partitions are already public images. What you need is their integrity protection. All system partitions are protected by [android verified boot 2.0](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/avb/+/master/README.md)",Android

Sony makes it so difficult to get excited about their phone line.,"For just a bit of background; I'm a photographer and I shoot Sony mirrorless. I've used a Samsung Note since the Note 8, and before that was mainly using LG. For the last few years I've been hoping Sony would *actually* partner up their phone and camera division to get some real interaction between devices, because they have one hell of a competitive advantage with the fact that Sony Alpha is the most adopted mirrorless range.

Well, come to find out, when they announced the Xperia 1 II, they also teased the [Xperia Pro](https://www.sony.com/electronics/professional-smartphones/xperia-pro/specifications). It was essentially an Xperia 1 II, but it bumped up to 12GB RAM and 512GB of internal storage, and *it includes and HDMI Input*. It can function as an external monitor, and allows tethered shooting with FTP uploading for captures.

I worked in a camera shop when it was announced. We had Sony reps in house every month. This thing was quite literally made for me and people like me. And the first I heard of it was this morning, when I was googling to see when the next Xperia phone might come and if they would actually do anything new with the Alpha brand. Suddenly I was all onboard with the Xperia Pro, then I realized it's still running a 865, and has taken more than a year to get a ""Coming Soon"" for US release. So now, I'm right back where I was. I'm real leery of buying a year old phone for likely $1400, but even if they update the line we'll probably be waiting another year for it to even release in the US.

What the hell is Sony doing? Do they have someone's nephew in charge of the phone division? How have they *not* already taken advantage of their huge pro photographer base for something like the Xperia Pro? They could even go a step further and put external recording capabilities in the Pro line, and they wouldn't even be cannibalizing sales of another division, because they don't offer anything that competes with something like the Atomos Ninja.",Android

Gmail delayed notifications workaround by forwarding your email to your SMS (or another email w/ an app that supports real-time notifications).,"I've seen many posts about Gmail delaying notifications over the past year or two but it didn't really affect me until recently. Googling didn't really get me anything feasible, the most credible workaround was to use ADB to turn off doze, which is not really what I wanna do.

Most cell phone provides in the U.S, maybe other countries too, provide an email to SMS gateway, for instance for T-Mobile it's `[your 10 digit number]@tmomail.net`.  Any emails to that address will get sent as an SMS to your number. I set up that as a forwarding email in Gmail (via desktop version), and I get the emails on Google Messages (even nicely formatted on Google's Messages app, they arrive as MMS). You can set a filter to only forward some emails as well. This puts the notifications as high priority because now they're not only real-time, but also they're in the ""conversations"" group reserved for chat apps. As a bonus, you don't even require internet for it to notify you.

Here is an article with more info, plus domains for prominent U.S. carriers: [Use Email to Send Text Messages (SMS) to Mobile Phones for Free (howtogeek.com)](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27051/use-email-to-send-text-messages-sms-to-mobile-phones-for-free/) 

Make sure to test this because they can have over-aggressive spam filters. For instance T-mobile's gateway seems to be blocking [www.bestbuy.com](https://www.bestbuy.com) so I never got those emails to my SMS.

Of course, you can also do this to auto-forward to another email service which has an app with real-time notifications, such as Outlook. And obviously you can also just switch to that other email service for important emails in the first place but it may be more cumbersome to give your new email address to other people (Outlook in particular is unreliable with its spam filter though in my experience).",Android

I am scared for the future of android phones!,"With companies getting less features in the box of the phone or in the phone and calling it some ""insert excuse BS here"". I bit my tongue for expendable storage and 3.5mm audio jack for my OnePlus 7 Pro.  
When I see the new high end phones from Samsung, Xiaomi getting the charger out of the box I am not satisfied because I sell my old phones with a charger and how it came with a box so I don't have a spare charger laying around...   
I guess I can always buy a wall brick from Anker but that is not the point.   
After the rumors that iPhone 13 will not have a charging port I can't wrap my head around that.   
Before my OnePlus 7 Pro I had Galaxy S8 and the wireless charging was alright but I still liked to plug my phone and extract data from that port.   
I hate that android phone makers try to be like Apple, the only reason I bought a phone X is because I did not like the Apple product and I want to stay away from it.

I Created an App to Simplify the Messaging Apps Fragmentation in Android - DM Me,"### TL;DR: 
I created an app that simplifies the messaging fragmentation in Android.   
Tap a contact to open your favorite messaging app that you both use (IE Telegram/Signal/Whatsapp...)

### [Download Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.rosenpin.dmme)

### Edit:
I created a **subreddit** for the app, where we can discuss features and I can post updates regarding the app. [**/r/DMMeApp**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMMeApp/). Please join! 😁

### Background
With all the WhatsApp/Facebook bandwagon lately many people have opted in and out of messaging platforms. Some installed Signal, some moved to Telegram, some stayed on WhatsApp and some still only use SMS   
I believe in the cause and personally installed both Signal and Telegram, but I couldn't help but be annoyed with the headache it caused.  

Having each contact on a different service makes it a chore to communicate with friends. Tell me if this sounds familiar  
""Does Mark use **WhatsApp**? or did he move to **Telegram**? Does he have **Signal**? I prefer texting him on **Signal** actually"" I open **Signal**, he's not there, going to **WhatsApp**, not there. Just lost 30 seconds I could use to browse Reddit.

### What it does
So I created DM Me, originally for my own use,
During setup it prompts you to order your messaging apps by priority.
It shows you a list of your contacts, tapping a contact will open the app you like the most that you're both use.

### Example:  
My order: **Signal**, **Telegram**, **WhatsApp**, **SMS**  
Mark has: **WhatsApp**, **SMS**  
Tapping Mark's contact will open my **WhatsApp** chat with him

### Screenshots:
[https://imgur.com/a/jeWeArB](https://imgur.com/a/jeWeArB)


### Early access
The app is still in early access, I just created the basics of what I want it to be. It's current features include  

- Ordering and reordering of your favorite messaging apps
- Contact pinning (favorite contacts stay on top)
- SMS support - in addition to your installed apps, it can also support SMS using your default SMS app
- Hiding contacts that don't have any supported communication platform
- It currently supports - Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp and SMS, I plan on adding Facebook Messanger and Viber

### Help from you
I have many features planned and I would LOVE to get more insights from you.  
If you are using a messaging app that DMMe still doesn't support, please let me know in the comments and I'll add it as soon as I can  
If you run into any bug, please let me know  
If anything during the setup isn't clear, please tell me  
If you have a better idea for the name of the app, I'd love to hear it :P",Android

Rise of third-party phone designs: ODMs,"It is not well known, but a majority of budget smartphones are designed by just five companies: Huaqin, Wingtech, LongCheer, CNCE (Chino-E), TINNO. Together, these five companies have near 85% of the ODM market share.

These smartphones are branded by companies like Xiaomi/OPPO and sold. The ODM is not only responsible for physical design of a phone, but is also responsible for the manufacture and software customization.

[Here is a look at the percentage of phones by each brand](https://imgur.com/a/PEcAqmV) for 2020 that are designed by ODMs. From top to bottom:

* Samsung 22%
* Huawei 18%
* Xiaomi 74%
* Oppo 51%
* Lenovo (Motorola) 89%
* Vivo (not shown, other estimates give &lt;10%)

[2019 Data](https://imgur.com/a/3Q2iNXJ):

* LG 56%
* Nokia 88%
* Meizu 0%

These ODMs are responsible primarily for budget devices, while the companies themselves usually design the flagships. This is the reason why so many budget smartphones look so similar, the ODMs generally do a good job synthesizing the popular hardware designs.

So it is quite likely that your Xiaomi/Oppo/Huawei/Vivo smartphone was designed by the exact same company, if not the exact same team inside an ODM.

Example 1 suspiciously similar devices by [Huawei](https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_enjoy_20_5g-10418.php), [Realme (Oppo)](https://www.gsmarena.com/realme_c11-10308.php), [Xiaomi](https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_redmi_9c_nfc-10277.php)

[Example 2](https://imgur.com/a/E1c134f)

Edit:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;ODM suppliers are responsible for R&amp;D, material procurement, and production, which contributes more to their revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, this is a reason why you should buy flagships, regardless if the phone is branded Samsung/Huawei/Xiaomi/Oppo/Vivo/Oneplus. You never know who is responsible for the updates for budget phones.",Android
"Android may not have an update cycle as long as iOS (Samsung longest so far with 3 yrs of software updates, 4 yrs security), but their update system is smart and practical.","You can separately update your stock apps through the Play Store. Your phone may not be on the latest Android software but your stock apps can be updated to the latest version. 

For example. Samsung stock apps like Messages, Contacts, Phone, Calendar, Calculator, Email, Weather, Keyboard, Camera etc can be updated separately on the Play Store or Galaxy Store. You can also force update em thru APKs. Every Samsung app has a special ""check for updates"" toggle on its settings that notifies you if an update is available for that specific stock app.

You can't do this in iOS, there needs to be a general software update that will then bring updates to the stock apps.

Thoughts on Android tablets after my experience with the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite,"Just in case you were about to buy an Android tablet... hear me out. (tl;dr at the end) 

Also I should mention for the record, prices are in USD. 

Right, so I should probably start off by saying that I really wanted to love my Tab S6 Lite. I wanted to tell myself that it was ""good enough"" for what I was using it for. But after a few frustrating and disappointing months, I eventually came to the conclusion that there are too many fundamental flaws with the experience, and I just can't bring myself to recommend it to anyone. The amount of missteps and cost-cuts they made when putting this together, and the amount of issues compared to my old iPad mini 4 that was $499 in 2015, is honestly baffling to me.

That being said, I think that Android tablets certainly have their place with sub-$100 devices from the likes of Amazon, meant for people who can't afford (or don't want to spend more on) the more premium devices, or for children who will easily break them. But I believe that these premium tablets that are being pushed as iPad-killers (mostly from Samsung) are just too flawed to be viable. Don't be fooled by the impressive low prices of things like the Tab S6 Lite or the Tab S7, with their nice designs and included s-pen. It's just simply not worth it. 

The following is a general list of reasons why I believe iPadOS is currently better for tablets than Android. (note: This applies to even comparing a $329 iPad to an $849 Tab S7+) 

• Better optimization for large screens in apps, especially in landscape mode (Twitter, Discord, and Firefox are all good examples of popular apps that are better on iPad, also the wasted space vs the iPad in apps like the Play Store and Facebook)  
• Able to sync with Signal messaging app  
• Exclusive creative/work apps (LumaFusion, iMovie, Affinity Photo, Affinity Designer, Procreate, Photoshop, Flip, Logic Remote, GarageBand, various note taking apps)  
• Multi-finger gestures (4 finger swipe up and hold for multitasking, 4 finger swipe up to go home, 5 finger pinch for multitasking, you might not find them useful, but especially those 4 finger gestures are very natural and fluid because of how similar they are to swiping up from the bottom)  
• Longer and more consistent software and security updates (and just in case this point or its importance hasn't clicked for you yet, here's a wake up call: the Tab S5e came out in 2019, and to my knowledge it isn't getting One UI 3.0 for another 6 months even though it's been out of beta for a few weeks, while the iPad Air 2 that came out in 2014 is on the latest version of iPadOS 14)  
• Stock keyboard is a better keyboard than anything on Android for tablets, due to the spacing afforded by the aspect ratio (imho)  
• Aspect ratio is also better for using apps and browsing the internet (it's generally worse for watching videos due to letterboxing, but the importance of that is debatable)  
• The likelihood of future apps getting full-on iPad support that don't have it yet (i.e. Apollo for Reddit) seems to be much higher than apps like Twitter and Discord getting more optimized apps on Android* 

The following is a list of gripes I have with the Tab S6 Lite; these may not apply to all Android tablets. 

• Unreliable and insecure biometric authentication compared to any iPad, or most other Android tablets for that matter (it's only facial recognition with the camera, so it doesn't work in the dark, it's not very secure, and even in ideal conditions it only works about 70% of the time, and you need to put in your pattern/pin every 24 hours for security reasons)  
• Awful blue light filter (instead of changing color temperature, it just applies a translucent yellow over the entire display, so for example black changes to dark yellow, and also it can't even be scheduled… ??????)  
• Significantly worse glare compared to newer iPads that have the anti-glare coating (from what I've seen this also applies to other Android tablets like the Tab S7)  
• Display isn't very good (it's LCD which is fine, but it's a TFT panel instead of IPS, which means it has really bad viewing angles and the colors are muted, I didn't think this would bother me but it's surprisingly sub-par even for the price imo)  
• Touch response is not very good (i.e. it feels 'jello-y' and lags behind the finger a bit more than something like a $329 iPad)  
• There are occasional stutters and pauses that tend to bog down the experience (even my mom's iPad Air 2 has less frequent stutters and a more responsive touch screen)  
• Multitasking is kind of pitiful (can only really hold 3 apps in RAM at one time, again I didn't think it would bother me but combined with the mediocre load times it can get irritating)  
• UI is noticeably lacking smoothness/responsiveness (i.e. going in and out of multitasking, going home, quick settings, opening an app, setting up split view)  
• For some reason I'm not allowed to use synced calls and texts with my (Samsung) phone (probably because of Verizon not allowing it to work or something, but still that is really stupid that this advertised feature straight up doesn't work)  
• Side note: if you were hoping to heavily customize a Samsung tablet, it doesn't come with the galaxy themes store and sideloading an apk of it doesn't work, so you can't use something like hex installer to customize it... bummer 

Of course there is a list of reasons why these premium Android tablets are better (DeX on some models, micro SD card support on some models, launcher and icon customization, emulators that are easy to install and work pretty well, FoRtNiTe, third party app stores like F-Droid [and some other apps and stores for dirty people who hate spending money], also pricing outside of the US is different I get that) but to me personally, these are vastly outweighed by the fundamental improvements to the tablet experience that iPadOS has by design. 

Sooo… yeah. Probably going to switch back to an iPad once I get a chance. Really unfortunate as I was hoping that this tablet would integrate better with my phone, but oh well. 

*side note: This last point may be purely speculation, however Signal is already syncing with iPads but not Android tablets, Apollo dev has confirmed that an iPad version is in the works, and we have no word on any of the problematic apps that I've mentioned getting improvements on Android (except for Signal but who knows how long that will take)


tl;dr: iPads are better than Android tablets in pretty much every single way these days. Cheap Android tablets are fine for the price and all, but if you're looking for anything over $300 you should probably be looking at an iPad.",Android

Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro Review,,Android
Am I imagining things or current flagships are starting to feel like a straight up downgrade?,"As said in the title, I'm still on my S9+ and all I've seen here its novelty in exchange of a lot less of functionality, sure your phone will look a tiny bit sharper and photos will improve if you upgrade to the flashy s21 ultra but you will lose good audio (bt it's worse than wired), expandable memory (so rip if you offload big files frequently), the charging brick (because the environment? Somehow?) and the iris scanner (bye bye to opening the phone in dark environments with gloves)

I've been waiting for the right phone to upgrade but each time I just feel that my current phone it's overall better in almost every way.

Edit. I get the point of the phone only keeping what people use the most, but the thing its that, whats the point of such high prices? how is it possible that a flagship in 2021 costs way more than a flagship of 2018 but it can do less? 
as said, the only thing that the s21 ultra does better than the s9+ its on the camera department and the screen refresh rate, the newer processor and uber ammount of ram? sure the phone its faster, but do you really notice? because I don't, my s9+ doesn't lag, it can open every single app in the playstore and storage its not an issue because... its expandable, the only thing making my phone feeling outdated its that the casing its getting yellow, there's some ghosting and the battery its starting to show signs of decay.... that's it, each one of this issues should be easy to fix and way cheaper than getting a new flagship.

My point its that I'm starting to get the feeling that flagships are no longer the best in the market, mid range its starting to look far more atractive, all the perks without much noticeable compromises",Android
What are some uses or what type of people actually need the high spec phones?,"I was wondering who actually takes daily use of the higher end features of their phones.

I don't mind the people who just want the high end just because but I was wondering what are some practical uses that enables people to need to use all their ram or their camera or what uses do they need for hundreds of gigs of storage or a highly upgraded 120hz screen.

Who's paying over a thousand dollars to constantly use their phones for playing games? Who pays that much to need the camera systems provided in a phone compared to a camera?

Setting aside ecosystems and buying it because it's high end what are some practical situations that would require someone to buy a high end phone for its specs?

I just want to reiterate that this is speculation and not a rant on people with those types of phones as I also like to indulge on getting phones that provide me more than I need for daily use. This is just a question I wanted to ask to see If I can get some repsonse and start a discussion on this topic.

edit: This is a question I just thought of. I am also one of these people who ends up buying a higher end phone and wondered what I actually did use it for. As an owner of all tiers of phones I honestly have no idea what my use for all these features are. The only thing I can say is that I appreciate being able to have many many many chrome tabs open without my phone crashing or slowing down.",Android

Mozilla and kiwi couldn't complete Jetstream test. I prefer to use Opera because of account syncing and some features and it is fast actually. Edge is my second browser. It is also really fast and easy to use.  I t has account sync too. Both edge and opera offer good customization . I tried to use Puffin before but don't like UI and UX . Vivaldi is still improved but not bad. Sometimes i use desktop version.

RCS surprised me this morning,"This morning I woke up and checked my new iPhone. No notifications and all seemed normal. I then walk past my previous phone (Galaxy S8) and noticed the notification LED going off.

I unlocked the phone and was surprised to see that I got a notification from Google Messages. Someone from my work was asking me to come in later than scheduled. My co-worker uses a Galaxy S10. Keep in mind, my S8 does not have an active SIM in it. 

I replied to the number on my iPhone amd turned off RCS on my S8. A reply was then sent to my iPhone and all is good. 

So...I think that I understand what happened here, but was very surprised RCS functioned in this way.

 Anyone else have RCS surprise them in a similar way?",Android

Samsung Galaxy Redesign vs Refresh,"I have has a Samsung galaxy phone since the S4 and have been upgrading every two year. I was always happy to upgrade because it seemed Samsung would do a complete redesign every two year then just refresh the previous model in between. I felt like I was on a good upgrade cycle.

E.g: S6=Redesign, S7= Refresh, S8=Redesign, S9= Refresh, S10= Redesign, S20= Refresh. 

Now looking at the leaks from the S21, this has been the first time that I have not seen any major reasons to get excited about upgrading my s10. I'm due for a new phone now but I'm thinking of waiting for the s̶3̶0̶ next Galaxy model that comes out in 2022. 

What is everyone else’s though on the Redesign vs Refresh cycle of the galaxy phones? Do you feel like the s20 &amp; upcoming s21 were/are redesigns or just a refreshed version of the s10? It may be that phones are so refined now that it either to hard to redesign or there is no good reason to redesign if the current design is still working well.

Edit: Changed ""waiting for the s30"" to ""the next Galaxy model that comes out in 2022"".",Android
Why don't phone manufacturers make matte screens?,"Matte phone screen would remove the need for oleophobic coating, be smudge resistant, be easier to maintain and use, and just be better overall. Why don't manufacturers make phone screens matte, like the matte glass they use on the back of a lot of phones? Is there a reason for this?",Android

Nova launcher now supports the fancy new gestures and app closing animation on pixel devices.,"As of v7.0.12 (beta from discord), nova launcher now supports the closing animation where the app shrinks into the icon. As far as I can tell, gesture navigation is basically fully supported completely by this third party launcher now, and I essentially have no reason to go back to the pixel launcher now.

Of note, this is only available on pixels, because it seems non-google OEMs aren't using the latest APIs that enable this.

Edit: appears removed in 13. I don't know if that guy meant to send/post that update?

Edit: it's back in v14",Android

Kind of shocked by how good my $150 phone is.,"My OnePlus 6T died after an unfortunate drop into concrete. I was expecting a call that day, so I went to a local store and bought a Moto G Fast thinking I'd use it temporarily before getting a ""real phone"" and I'd keep the Moto G as a backup.

You know what though? I'm keeping it as my daily driver. It's actually *shockingly* good. The battery lasts longer than my old phone. It's got a headphone jack! What $1000 phone has one if those these days? It's not filled with bloatware, and it does the basics all pretty well. Calls sound no different. The speaker is good enough. The vibration motor is significantly better than my previous phone. 

I thought I'd mind a 720p display, but honestly I've stopped noticing. Who needs 90hz 1440p displays anyway? It just seems like overkill to me now.

Sure, it's not always the snappiest device in the world and isn't made of super premium materials. It's got bigger bezels than a higher tier phone would have. But who cares? Honestly the only thing that bothers me really is Motorola's update policy. But I've used plenty of other much more expensive phones with pretty shit update policies too.",Android
